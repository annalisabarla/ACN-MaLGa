A local algorithm for the computation of the optical flow which uses second order derivatives of the image brightness pattern, and that avoids the aperture problem, is presented. The obtained optical flow is very similar to the true motion field — which is the vector field associated with moving features on the image plane — and can be used to recover 3D motion information. Experimental results on sequences of real images, together with estimates of relevant motion parameters, like time-to-crash for translation and angular velocity for rotation, are presented and discussed. Due to the remarkable accuracy which can be achieved in estimating motion parameters, the proposed method is likely to be very useful in a number of computer vision applications.",
5,Generalized Eulerian numbers and the topology of the Hessenberg variety of a matrix,1988,"De Mari F., Shayman M.A.",Acta Applicandae Mathematicae,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00046881,CHarML,"Let A∈gl(n, C) and let p be a positive integer. The Hessenberg variety of degree p for A is the subvariety Hess(p, A) of the complete flag manifold consisting of those flags S1⊂⋯⊂Sn−1in ℂn which satisfy the condition ASi⊂Si+p,for all i. We show that if A has distinct eigenvalues, then Hess(p, A) is smooth and connected. The odd Betti numbers of Hess(p, A) vanish, while the even Betti numbers are given by a natural generalization of the Eulerian numbers. In the case where the eigenvalues of A have distinct moduli, |λ1|<⋯<|λ1|, these results are applied to determine the dimension and topology of the submanifold of U(n) consisting of those unitary matrices P for which A0=P-1AP is in Hessenberg form and for which the diagonal entries of the QR-iteration initialized at A0 converge to a given permutation of λ1,λn.",

When the two images of the same scene are taken from quite different points of view, matching corresponding elements can be difficult. It is desirable therefore to consider perspective projection invariants, that is, features or image properties that are invariant for arbitrary perspective projections. We prove theorems about the projections of zeros of curvature of curves, namely, that zeros of curvatures of planar curves are perspective invariants and that zeros of curvature of arbitrary curves are almost always perspective invariants. We also show that the projected zeros of curvature of planar curves are only stable for deformations occurring in the plane of the curve.","Curvature, Machine vision, Opacity, Stereo matching, Three dimensional reconstruction, Vision"

Interpretation of 3D Scenes,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/68100,PiMLB,"It is shown that when a priori information on the mutual direction of straight lines in the 3D scene is available, vanishing points can be extracted and located reliably on the image plane. Then, by using simple properties of vanishing points, it is possible to perform efficiently several visual tasks, such as estimating the rotational component of motion between the viewer and the scene, and identifying and recovering the orientation and relative position in space of the viewed planar patches. Extensive experimentation on real images shows that vanishing points are usually identified and located correctly, even in cluttered images. It is concluded that the proposed approach can be very helpful for the development of effective vision systems.<>","Aerospace industry, Cultural differences, Data mining, Geometry, Humans, Image analysis, Layout, Machine vision, Motion estimation, Physics computing"
8,Analysis of differential and matching methods for optical flow,1989,"Little J. J., Verri A.",Workshop on Visual Motion 1989,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/47107,PiMLB," A number of algorithms for optical flow are studied on both a theoretical and an experimental ground. Differential and matching methods are examined. Both types of optical-flow algorithms can use either local or global constraints, such as spatial smoothness, in computing the flow. Local matching and differential techniques and global differential techniques are examined. The traditional algorithms for optical flow utilize weak assumptions on the local variation of the flow, and on the variation of image brightness. Strengthening these assumptions improves the flow computation. The computational consequence of this is a necessity for larger spatial and temporal support. Using larger support is valid when constraints on the local shape of the flow are satisfied. Experiments show the behavior of these optical-flow methods on velocity fields which do not obey the assumptions. Implementation of these methods highlights the importance of numerical differentiation.","Image motion analysis, Shape, Optical computing, Artificial intelligence, Brightness, Contracts,Smoothing methods, Computer science, Application software, Pixel,

9,Constraints for the computation of optical flow,1989,"Girosi F., Verri A., Torre V.",Workshop on Visual Motion 1989,https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/wvm/1989/00047101/12OmNz6iO3C,PiMLB," A number of constraints are proposed for which both the components of optical flow can be obtained by local differential techniques and the aperture problem can usually be solved. The constraints are suggested by the observation that it is possible to describe spatial and temporal changes of the image brightness in terms of infinitesimal deformations. An arbitrary choice of two of the four equations which correspond to the elementary deformations of a 2-D pattern implies that the spatial gradient of the image brightness is stationary and leads to a linear system of equations for optical flow which seems best suited for numerical implementation on real data in the absence of a priori information. In that case, the error term between the computed optical flow and the motion field-that is, the 2-D vector field associated with the true displacement of points on the image plane-is derived and the conditions under which it can safely be neglected are discussed. Experiments on real images are reported which show that the obtained optical flows allow the estimate of 3-D motion parameters, the detection of discontinuities in the flow field, and the segmentation of the image in different moving objects."," optical flow, computer vision"
10,Mathematical properties of the 2D motion field: from singular points to motion parameters,1989,"Verri A., Girosi F., Torre V.",Workshop on Visual Motion 1989,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/47109,PiMLB," The authors study the mathematical properties of the 2-D motion field which are useful for motion understanding. It has been shown that the location and the nature of singular points of the motion field carry most of the relevant information on 3-D motion. Moreover, since the singular points of the motion field are usually structurally stable, the extraction of 3-D motion information from them is robust against noise and small perturbations. The practical relevance of the proposed approach is justified by the observation that it is possible to obtain from a time-varying sequence of images a 2-D vector field which is very close to the true motion field. As a consequence the recovery of 3-D motion from structurally stable properties of the optical flow is feasible and provides good experimental results. Therefore, the whole framework seems very appropriate for computer vision","Motion estimation, Motion analysis, Differential equations, Layout, Image sequences, Image analysis, Image motion analysis, Computer vision, Image segmentation, Structural engineering, computer vision, mathematical properties, 2-D motion field, singular points, motion parameters, time-varying sequence, 2-D vector field, structurally stable properties, computer vision"

Therefore the theory of planar dynamical systems can be used to understand qualitative and quantitative properties of motion. In this paper it is shown that singular points of the motion field, which are the points where the field vanishes, and the time evolution of their local structure capture essential features of three-dimensional motion that make it possible to distinguish translation, rotation, and general motion and also make possible the computation of the relevant motion parameters. Singular points of the motion field are the perspective projection onto the image plane of the intersection between a curve called the characteristic curve, which depends on only motion parameters, and the surface of the moving object. In most cases, singular points of the motion field are left unchanged in location and spatial structure by small perturbations affecting the vector field. Therefore a description of motion based on singular points can be used even when the motion field of an image sequence has not been estimated with high accuracy.","Machine vision, Motion analysis, Motion estimation, Optical flow, Surfaces, Three dimensional imaging"
12,Motion Field and Optical Flow: Qualitative Properties,1989,"Verri A., Poggio T.",IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1109/34.24781,PiMLB,"It is shown that the motion field the 2-D vector field which is the perspective projection on the image plane of the 3-D velocity field of a moving scene, and the optical flow, defined as the estimate of the motion field which can be derived from the first-order variation of the image brightness pattern, are in general different, unless special conditions are satisfied. Therefore, dense optical flow is often ill-suited for computing structure from motion and for reconstructing the 3-D velocity field by algorithms which require a locally accurate estimate of the motion field. A different use of the optical flow is suggested. It is shown that the (smoothed) optical flow and the motion field can be interpreted as vector fields tangent to flows of planar dynamical systems. Stable qualitative properties of the motion field, which give useful informations about the 3-D velocity field and the 3-D structure of the scene, usually can be obtained from the optical flow. The idea is supported by results from the theory of structural stability of dynamical systems.<>","Artificial intelligence, Biomedical optical imaging, Brightness, Image motion analysis, Image reconstruction, Laboratories, Layout, Motion estimation, Optical computing, Surface reconstruction"
13,Computing optical flow from an overconstrained system of linear algebraic equations,1990,"Campani M., Verri A.",Proc. 3rd Int. Conf. Comput. Vis.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/139485?anchor=citations,PiMLB,"A method is presented for the recovery of optical flow. The key idea is that the local spatial structure of optical flow, with the exception of surface boundaries, is usually rather coherent and can thus be appropriately approximated by a linear vector field. According to the proposed method, the optical flow components and their first order spatial derivatives are computed at the central points of rather large and overlapping patches which cover the image plane as the solution to a highly overconstrained system of linear algebraic equations. The equations, which are solved through the use of standard least mean square techniques, are derived from the assumptions that the changing image brightness is stationary everywhere over time and that optical flow is, locally, a linear vector field. The method has been tested on many sequences of synthetic and real images and the obtained optical flow has been used to estimate three-dimensional motion parameters with very good results.<>","Brightness, Equations, Image motion analysis, Least squares approximation, Linear approximation, Motion estimation, Optical computing, Optical devices, Testing, Vectors"
14,Differential techniques for optical flow,1990,"Verri A., Girosi F., Torre V.","Journal of the Optical Society of America A: Optics and Image Science, and Vision",https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.7.000912,PiMLB,"We show that optical flow, i.e., the apparent motion of the time-varying brightness over the image plane of an imaging device, can be estimated by means of simple differential techniques. Linear algebraic equations for the two components of optical flow at each image location are derived. The coefficients of these equations are combinations of spatial and temporal derivatives of the image brightness. The equations are suggested by an analogy with the theory of deformable bodies and are exactly true for particular classes of motion or elementary deformations. Locally, a generic optical flow can be approximated by using a constant term and a suitable combination of four elementary deformations of the time-varying image brightness, namely, a uniform expansion, a pure rotation, and two orthogonal components of shear. When two of the four equations that correspond to these deformations are satisfied, optical flow can more conveniently be computed by assuming that the spatial gradient of the image brightness is stationary. In this case, it is also possible to evaluate the difference between optical flow and motion field—that is, the two-dimensional vector field that is associated with the true displacement of points on the image plane. Experiments on sequences of real images are reported in which the obtained optical flows are used successfully for the estimate of three-dimensional motion parameters, the detection of flow discontinuities, and the segmentation of the image in different moving objects.","Apparent images, Brightness, Machine vision, Motion analysis, Optical flow, Three dimensional reconstruction"

In this paper, it is shown that, for any possible rigid motion, there cannot be limit cycles in the motion field of a planar surface. Therefore, the presence of limit cycles in the motion field is necessarily due to the non-planar structure of the viewed scene. An experiment on real images is also presented in which a limit cycle occurs when two planar patches have different orientation in space rotate around a fixed axis.",

Little is known of how the brain derives this information. One possibility is that it analyzes first-order elementary components of optical flow, such as expansion, rotation, and shear. Using a combination of physiological recordings and modeling techniques, we investigated the contribution of the middle superior temporal area (MST), a third-order cortical area in the dorsal visual pathway that receives inputs from the medial temporal area (MT). The results show (i) that MST cells, but not MT cells, are selective for elementary flow components (EFCs) alone or their combination with translation, (ii) that MST cells selective for an EFC do not extract this component from a more complex motion pattern, and (iii) that position invariance as observed in MST is compatible with an input arrangement from MT cells matching the selectivity of MST neurons.",

The system was tested on a set of thirteen toy cars arbitrarily positioned on a turntable and viewed from a fixed, uncalibrated camera, and compared against methods based on moments (MB) and on Hausdorff distance (HDB). Since the system outperforms MB methods in terms of percentages of success and the HDB method in terms of efficiency, it is concluded that size functions can be very useful for aspect-based recognition.","Angular velocity, Cameras, Object recognition, Shape, Solid modeling, System testing, Two dimensional displays, Visual perception"

The method uses the full perspective camera model and requires the estimation of the optical flow at a minimum of six image locations. The key observation is that the optical flow equations can be written in terms of the epipole in a strikingly simple form if the translational and rotational flow components are not separated as done usually. The epipole location can then be obtained as the minimum of a least-square residual function associated to the computed optical flow. We report and discuss initial experiments on both synthetic and real data and illustrate possible developments of this method towards the use of uncalibrated optical flow for 3-D motion and structure reconstruction.","Cameras, Equations, Geometry, Image motion analysis, Image reconstruction, Minimization methods, Noise robustness, Optical computing, Optical devices, Tensile stress"

This surface, which in some feature space of possibly infinite dimension can be regarded as a hyperplane, is obtained from the solution of a problem of quadratic programming that depends on a regularization parameter. In this article, we study some mathematical properties of support vectors and show that the decision surface can be written as the sum of two orthogonal terms, the first depending on only the margin vectors (which are SVs lying on the margin), the second proportional to the regularization parameter. For almost all values of the parameter, this enables us to predict how the decision surface varies for small parameter changes. In the special but important case of feature space of finite dimension m, we also show that there are at most m + 1 margin vectors and observe that m + 1 SVs are usually sufficient to determine the decision surface fully. For relatively small m, this latter result leads to a consistent reduction of the SV number.",

Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition.","Colored noise, Computer vision, Feature extraction, Image databases, Image recognition, Object recognition, Pattern recognition, Spatial databases, Support vector machines, Testing"

The NNT can be applied to correlated data with virtually no preprocessing and does not require assumptions on the shape of the various probability distributions. We compare the performance of NNT on electron identification in experiment E760 at FNAL against a standard likelihood technique, and find that NNT gives better results, particularly in the rejection rates. We conclude that NNT, which is conceptually clear and easy to implement and use, can be very useful for PID.","Particle identification, Pattern recognition, Statistical analysis"

Each event is represented by a feature vector built from the spatio-temporal changes detected in the observed image sequence. The system neither attempts to recover the 3D structure nor assumes a prior model of the observed dynamic events. During training a supervisor identifies and labels the events of interest among those automatically detected by the system. At run time, previously unseen events are detected and classified on the basis of the available examples. Several experiments on real images are reported and the benefits of using Support Vector Machines for performing effective classification from a relatively small number of labeled examples and for building noise tolerant representations are discussed.

This generates an MPEG-4 compliant, layered representation useful for video coding, editing and indexing. First, a mosaic of the static background is computed by estimating the dominant motion of the scene. This is achieved by tracking features over the video sequence and using a robust technique that discards features attached to the moving objects. The moving objects get removed in the final mosaic by computing the median of the grey levels. Then, segmentation is obtained by taking the pixelwise difference between each frame of the original sequence and the mosaic of the background. To discriminate between the moving object and noise, temporal coherence is exploited by tracking the object in the binarised difference image sequence. The automatic computation of the mosaic and the segmentation procedure are illustrated with real sequences experiments. Examples of coding and content-based manipulation are also shown.",

The main outcome of our analysis is that for classification, the hinge loss appears to be the loss of choice. Other things being equal, the hinge loss leads to a convergence rate practically indistinguishable from the logistic loss rate and much better than the square loss rate. Furthermore, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the bounds obtained for the hinge loss are not loosened by the thresholding stage.",

Second, we show that the case in which the offset space is non trivial corresponds to solving a standard problem of regularization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space in which the penalty term is given by a seminorm.

From the specialization of our analysis to the discrete setting it is immediate to establish a connection between the solution properties of sparsity and coefficient boundedness and some properties of the loss function.

A quantitative feature selection criterion inspired by maximum likelihood is then used in conjunction with Spearman’s independence rank test to select a maximal subset of discriminative and pairwise independent features. Classiﬁcation is performed by a sequence of hypothesis tests for the presence of the object. The overall signiﬁcance level (i.e. the operating point) can be set by controlling the signiﬁcance level of the individual tests as well as the minimum number of them that a candidate window is required to pass. We report experiments on face detection over the MIT-CBCL database. The image measurements we use for these experiments include grey level values, integral measurements and ranklets. Our results indicate that the method is able to generalize from positive examples only and reaches state-of-the-art recognition rates.",

The system core structure is a 3D-range scan based on the well known active triangulation procedure and made of a camera, a laser light emitter and a software driven motor. The core system allows us to acquire dense point clouds of objects of about 50 cm. The system today hosts a second camera and thus is able to perform 3D reconstruction from two slightly different viewpoints and produce more dense point clouds. Also, since the motor can be driven back to the original position multiple scans can take place, to obtain smooth surfaces, and multiple information, such as texture and reliability measures. An alternative way of obtaining texture information is by means of a linear camera, also included in the system. We present results obtained with the current system, and describe extensions of the system in estimating noise and producing a more complex geometry description.","Cameras, Clouds, Data acquisition, Light emitting diodes, Multisensor systems, Open systems, Sensor systems, Surface emitting lasers, Surface reconstruction, Surface texture"

The first stage requires the computation of a large number of image features. Simple significance tests and the maximum likelihood principle are at the basis of the second stage in which a saliency measure is used to reject the features which do not appear to be descriptive of the given data set. The third and final stage, by using the Spearman independence rank test, selects a maximal number of pairwise independent features.

In particular it is well known that regularization schemes such as Tikhonov regularization can be effectively used in the context of learning and are closely related to algorithms such as support vector machines. Nevertheless the connection with inverse problem was considered only for the discrete (ﬁnite sample) problem and the probabilistic aspects of learning from examples were not taken into account. In this paper we provide a natural extension of such analysis to the continuous (population) case and study the interplay between the discrete and continuous problems. From a theoretical point of view, this allows to draw a clear connection between the consistency approach in learning theory and the stability convergence property in ill-posed inverse problems. The main mathematical result of the paper is a new probabilistic bound for the regularized least-squares algorithm. By means of standard results on the approximation term, the consistency of the algorithm easily follows.",

The method we discuss here is a version of the SVD-matching proposed by Scott and LonguetHiggins and later modiﬁed by Pilu, that we elaborate in order to cope with large scale variations. To this end we add to the feature detection phase a keypoint descriptor that is robust to large scale and view-point changes. Furthermore, we include this descriptor in the equations of the proximity matrix that is central to the SVD-matching. At the same time we remove from the proximity matrix all the information about the point locations in the image, that is the source of mismatches when the amount of scene variation increases.

For computational efficiency and memory requirements, instead of implementing the full optimization scheme on tenths of thousands of features, we propose to first solve a number of smaller size optimization problems obtained by randomly sub-sampling the feature vector, and then recombining the selected features. The obtained set is still highly redundant, so we further apply feature selection. The final feature selection system is an efficient two-stages architecture.

The ﬁrst is a gene selection core, based on elastic net regularization where we explicitly take into account regularization parameter tuning.

It is common to adopt resampling methods to tune and evaluate marker-based diagnostic and prognostic systems in order to prevent selection bias. Such caution promotes honest estimation of class prediction, but leads to alternative sets of solutions. In microarray studies, the difference in lists may be bewildering, also due to the presence of modules of functionally related genes. Methods for assessing stability understand the dependency of the markers on the data or on the predictor's type and help selecting solutions.Results: A computational framework for comparing sets of ranked biomarker lists is presented. Notions and algorithms are based on concepts from permutation group theory. We introduce several algebraic indicators and metric methods for symmetric groups, including the Canberra distance, a weighted version of Spearman's footrule. We also consider distances between partial lists and an aggregation of sets of lists into an optimal list based on voting theory (Borda count). The stability indicators are applied in practical situations to several synthetic, cancer microarray and proteomics datasets. The addressed issues are predictive classification, presence of modules, comparison of alternative biomarker lists, outlier removal, control of selection bias by randomization techniques and enrichment analysis.Availability: Supplementary Material and software are available at the address http://biodcv.fbk.eu/listspy.htmlContact:furlan@fbk.euSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Most available statistical tools for gene signature extraction typically provide unstructured list of genes and lack the capability of handling correlation among genes. Recently an algorithm for feature selection, namely elastic net, was proposed allowing to deal with correlated genes in a transparent way. In this work we exploit the form of the output given by elastic net, as used in De Mol et al. (2007), to obtain a structured gene signature where genes are disposed in block of intra-correlated genes and the blocks are ranked according to a measure of the block discriminative power. After recalling how elastic net can be used to define nested lists of increasingly intra-correlated genes, we propose an ad hoc agglomerative clustering technique able to refine such a nested output by explicitly identifying modules of correlated genes. We take advantage of such a structure to visualize the correlation patterns underlying the data. The proposed procedure is validated on both synthetic data and applied to real gene expression datasets.","Bioinformatics, Biological processes, Biology, Data mining, Data visualization, Gene expression, Genomics, Input variables, Power measurement, Time measurement"

Preprocessing and machine-learning modules are pipelined, starting from raw spectra, to set up a predictive classifier based on a shortlist of candidate features. As a machine-learning problem, proteomic profiling on MS data needs caution like the microarray case. The risk of overfitting and of selection bias effects is pervasive: not only potential features easily outnumber samples by 103 times, but it is easy to neglect information-leakage effects during preprocessing from spectra to peaks. The aim of this review is to explain how to build a general purpose design analysis protocol (DAP) for predictive proteomic profiling: we show how to limit leakage due to parameter tuning and how to organize classification and ranking on large numbers of replicate versions of the original data to avoid selection bias. The DAP can be used with alternative components, i.e. with different preprocessing methods (peak clustering or wavelet based), classifiers e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM) or feature ranking methods (recursive feature elimination or I-Relief). A procedure for assessing stability and predictive value of the resulting biomarkers’ list is also provided.

The Magnetic Iron Detector (MID) measures the magnetic track of a person, which depends on the anthropometric characteristics and the body-iron burden. We aim to provide an estimate of this signal in absence of iron overload. We show how this question can be formulated as the estimation of a vector-valued function which encompasses the prior knowledge on the shape of the magnetic track.

While accurate prediction can be achieved by means of many different techniques, gene identification, due to gene correlation and the limited number of available samples, is a much more elusive problem. Small changes in the expression values often produce different gene lists, and solutions which are both sparse and stable are difficult to obtain. We propose a two-stage regularization method able to learn linear models characterized by a high prediction performance. By varying a suitable parameter these linear models allow to trade sparsity for the inclusion of correlated genes and to produce gene lists which are almost perfectly nested.

For our initial representation, we adopt rectangular features in order to allow straightforward comparisons with existing techniques. For computational efficiency and memory saving requirements, instead of implementing the full optimization scheme on tenths of thousands of features, we propose a three-stage architecture which consists of finding first intermediate solutions to smaller size optimization problems, then merging the obtained results, and next applying further selection procedures. The devised system requires the solution of a number of independent problems, and, hence, the necessary computations could be implemented in parallel. Experimental results obtained on both benchmark and newly acquired face and eyes images indicate that our method is a serious competitor to other feature selection schemes recently popularized in computer vision for dealing with problems of real-time object detection. A major advantage of the proposed system is that it performs well even with relatively small training sets.","Image classification, Computational efficiency, Dictionaries, Computer architecture, Face detection, Equations, Eyes, Face features, feature selection, Iterative algorithms, Linear systems, Merging, regularization methods, sparsity-enforcing penalty"

Our setting is random-design regression where we allow the response variable to be vector-valued and we consider prediction functions which are linear combinations of elements (features) in an infinite-dimensional dictionary. Under the assumption that the regression function admits a sparse representation on the dictionary, we prove that there exists a particular “elastic-net representation” of the regression function such that, if the number of data increases, the elastic-net estimator is consistent not only for prediction but also for variable/feature selection. Our results include finite-sample bounds and an adaptive scheme to select the regularization parameter.

Actuarial methods were used to evaluate rate of local tumor control, eye retention, and survival after proton beam radiotherapy. Cox regression models were extracted to evaluate univariate risk factors, while regularized least squares algorithm was used to have a multivariate classification model to better discriminate risk factors.ResultsTumor relapse occurred in 8.4% of the eyes, with a median recurrence time of 46 months. Enucleation was performed on 11.7% of the eyes after a median time of 49 months following proton beam; out of these, 29 eyes were enucleated due to relapse and 16 due to other causes.

This paper focuses in particular on the crowd estimation problem: we propose a solution to detect and localize groups of people, able to provide an estimate of the number of people in the scene.",

To determine the capability and reliability of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in the assessment of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods. DCE-MRI of the clinically more affected wrist or hip joints was undertaken in 21 patients, coupled with standard clinical assessment and biochemical analysis. Synovial inflammation was assessed by computing the maximum level of synovial enhancement (ME), the maximum rate of enhancement (MV) and the rate of early enhancement (REE) from the enhancement curves generated from region of interest independently delineated by two readers in the area of the ME. Correlations between dynamic parameters and clinical measures of disease activity, and static MRI synovitis score were investigated. Results. In patients with wrist arthritis, REE correlated with the wrist swelling score (rs = 0.72), ESR (rs = 0.69), pain assessment scale (rs = 0.63) and childhood HAQ (rs = 0.60). In patients with hip arthritis, ME correlated with the hip limitation of motion (rs = 0.69). Static MRI synovitis score based on post-gadolinium enhancement correlated with MV (rs = 0.63) in patients with wrist arthritis and with ME (r = 0.68) in those with hip arthritis. The inter-reader agreement assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for ME, MV and REE (ICC = 0.98, 0.97 and 0.84, respectively) was excellent. Conclusions. DCE-MRI represents a promising method for the assessment of disease activity in JIA, especially in patients with wrist arthritis. As far as we know, this study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility, reliability and construct validity of DCE-MRI in JIA. These results should be confirmed in large-scale longitudinal studies in view of its further application in therapeutic decision making and in clinical trials.","MRI, Dynamic contrast enhancement MRI, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Disease activity"

The goal of the paper is twofold. First we discuss how proximal methods can be applied to solve a large class of machine learning algorithms which can be seen as extensions of ℓ1 regularization, namely structured sparsity regularization. For all these algorithms, it is possible to derive an optimization procedure which corresponds to an iterative projection algorithm. Second, we discuss the effect of a preconditioning of the optimization procedure achieved by adding a strictly convex functional to the objective function. Structured sparsity algorithms are usually based on minimizing a convex (not strictly convex) objective function and this might lead to undesired unstable behavior. We show that by perturbing the objective function by a small strictly convex term we often reduce substantially the number of required computations without affecting the prediction performance of the obtained solution.","Multiple Kernel Learning, Proximal Method, Group Lasso, Regularization Algorithm, Reproduce Kernel Hilbert Space"

In our study we consider in particular variable-size HoGs, whose internal structure is composed by cells and blocks: since the entries of a block need to be computed together, the feature selection process is designed so to keep them or discard them all. The detection algorithm we obtain is a very neat procedure, simple to train and computationally efficient, which allows us to achieve a very good compromise between performance and computational cost, making the method very appropriate for video surveillance applications.","Histograms, Feature extraction, Training, Dictionaries, Vectors, Face, Protocols"

However, learned dictionaries require the solution of a sparse approximation problem for coding new data. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose an algorithm aimed at learning both a dictionary and its dual: a linear mapping directly performing the coding. Our algorithm is based on proximal methods and jointly minimizes the reconstruction error of the dictionary and the coding error of its dual; the sparsity of the representation is induced by an ℓ1-based penalty on its coefficients. Experimental results show that the algorithm is capable of recovering the expected dictionaries. Furthermore, on a benchmark dataset the image features obtained from the dual matrix yield state-of-the-art classification performance while being much less computational intensive.","Sparse Code, Sparse Representation, Dictionary LEarning, Proximal Method, Reconstruction Error"

A camera installed on board of the vehicle acquires images that are used for estimating the relative position of the camera between two consecutive images. A crucial point of the analysis, and the main objective of this work, is the estimation of the fundamental matrix F, considering the fact that in most cases we deal with a quasi-degenerate configuration. Indeed, the distance between the spacecraft (and the camera) and the planet surface, together with the morphology of the ground, make the problem difficult since most of the points will be extracted from a dominating plane.

A fundamental working hypothesis of these techniques is that the optimal partition of K classes can be obtained from the first K eigenvectors of the graph normalized Laplacian matrix LN if the gap between the K-th and the K+1-th eigenvalue of LN is sufficiently large. If the gap is small a perturbation may swap the corresponding eigenvectors and the results can be very different from the optimal ones. In this paper we suggest a weaker working hypothesis: the optimal partition of K classes can be obtained from a K-dimensional subspace of the first M>K eigenvectors, where M is a parameter chosen by the user. We show that the validity of this hypothesis can be confirmed by the gap size between the K-th and the M+1-th eigenvalue of LN. Finally we present and analyse a simple probabilistic algorithm that generalizes current spectral techniques in this extended framework. This algorithm gives results on real world graphs that are close to the state of the art by selecting correct K-dimensional subspaces of the linear span of the first M eigenvectors, robust to small changes of the eigenvalues.","Spectral clustering, Spectral gap"

It has been suggested that one reason for these inconsistencies may be that in complex diseases, such as cancer, multiple genes belonging to one or more physiological pathways are associated with the outcomes. Thus, a possible approach to improve list interpretability is to integrate biological information from genomic databases in the learning process. Here we propose KDVS, a machine learning based pipeline that incorporates domain biological knowledge a priori to structure the data matrix before the feature selection and classiﬁcation phases. The pipeline is completed by a ﬁnal step of semantic clustering and visualization. The clustering phase provides further interpretability of the results, allowing the identiﬁcation of their biological meaning.

However, methodologies for the discovery of biomarkers using microarray data often provide results with limited overlap. These differences are imputable to 1) dataset size (few subjects with respect to the number of features); 2) heterogeneity of the disease; 3) heterogeneity of experimental protocols and computational pipelines employed in the analysis. In this paper, we focus on the first two issues and assess, both on simulated (through an in silico regulation network model) and real clinical datasets, the consistency of candidate biomarkers provided by a number of different methods. Methods We extensively simulated the effect of heterogeneity characteristic of complex diseases on different sets of microarray data. Heterogeneity was reproduced by simulating both intrinsic variability of the population and the alteration of regulatory mechanisms. Population variability was simulated by modeling evolution of a pool of subjects; then, a subset of them underwent alterations in regulatory mechanisms so as to mimic the disease state. Results The simulated data allowed us to outline advantages and drawbacks of different methods across multiple studies and varying number of samples and to evaluate precision of feature selection on a benchmark with known biomarkers. Although comparable classification accuracy was reached by different methods, the use of external cross-validation loops is helpful in finding features with a higher degree of precision and stability. Application to real data confirmed these results.","Support vector machines, Algorithms, Biomarkers, Breast cancer, Gene expression, Microarrays, Simulation and modeling, Statistical data"

Starting off from a set of data meaningful of the common events in a given scenario, the pipeline we propose includes a data abstraction level, that allows us to process different data in a homogeneous way, and a behavior modeling level, based on spectral clustering. At the end of the pipeline we obtain a model of the behaviors which are more frequent in the observed scene, represented by a prototypical behavior, which we call a cluster candidate. We report a detailed experimental evaluation referring to both benchmark datasets and on a complex set of data collected in-house. The experiments show that our method compares very favorably with other approaches from the recent literature. In particular the results we obtain prove that our method is able to capture meaningful information and discard noisy one from very heterogeneous datasets with different levels of prior information available.","Anomaly detection, Behavior analysis, Temporal series clustering, Unsupervised learning"

Methods The tool was tested on 58 patients with JIA and wrist involvement. Thirty-six patients had a 1-year MRI followup. MRI of the clinically more affected wrist was performed using a 1.5T scanner and a Flex small coil. An algorithmic approach, based on supervised voxel classification for automatic estimation of SV in a 3-dimensional MRI, was developed. The SV was estimated as the number of positively classified voxels and then normalized by the patient's body surface (NSV). Validation procedures included the analysis of reliability, construct validity, responsiveness to change, discriminant validity, and the predictive value. Results The agreement between the automated estimation of NSV and the manual measurements was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.79–0.98). The automatic NSV demonstrated good construct validity by yielding strong correlations with local signs of disease activity and a moderate correlation with global physician assessment of disease activity and with the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring system synovitis score. NSV showed a strong responsiveness to clinical change (standardized response mean values >1) and satisfactory discriminant validity. High baseline NSV (>4.6) had high predictive value (100%) with respect to erosive progression. Conclusion The proposed automated method allowed reliable quantification of NSV, which represents a promising imaging biomarker of disease activity in JIA. The automated system has the potential to improve the longitudinal assessment of JIA and to predict progressive joint destruction.",

The architecture consists of a compositional model that divides the arm-hand action recognition problem into three levels.

The middle level serves to classify action primitives through descriptors obtained from 3D Histogram of Flow (3D-HOF); we further apply a sparse coding (SC) algorithm to deal with noise. Action Primitives are then modelled and classified by linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and we propose an on-line algorithm to cope with the real-time recognition of primitive sequences. The top level system synthesises combinations of primitives by means of a syntactic approach. In summary the main contribution of the paper is an incremental method for 3D arm-hand behaviour modelling and recognition, fully implemented and tested on the iCub robot, allowing it to learn new actions after a single demonstration.","Histograms, Accuracy, Three-dimensional displays, Computational modeling, Robots, Vectors, Encoding"

This paper deals with the problem of finding sparse and discriminative representations of images in multi-class settings. We propose a new regularized functional, which is a modification of the standard dictionary learning problem, designed to learn one dictionary per class. With this new formulation, while positive examples are constrained to have sparse descriptions, we also consider a contribution from negative examples which are forced to be described in a denser and smoother way. The descriptions we obtain are meaningful for a given class and highly discriminative with respect to other classes, and at the same time they guarantee real-time performances. We also propose a new approach to the classification of single image features which is based on the dictionary response. Thanks to this formulation it is possible to directly classify local features based on their sparsity factor without losing statistical information or spatial configuration and being more robust to clutter and occlusions. We validate the proposed approach in two image classification scenarios, namely single instance object recognition and object categorization.

At the crossover about the two different types of expertise, we offered some definition about Systems Biology. The core of the article deals with a Molecular Interaction Map (MIM), a network of biochemical interactions involved in a small signaling-network sub-region relevant in breast cancer. We explored robustness/sensitivity to random perturbations. It turns out that our MIM is a non-isomorphic directed graph. For non physiological directions of propagation of the signal the network is quite resistant to perturbations. The opposite happens for biologically significant directions of signal propagation. In these cases we can have no signal attenuation, and even signal amplification. Signal propagation along a given pathway is highly unidirectional, with the exception of signal-feedbacks, that again have a specific biological role and significance. In conclusion, even a relatively small network like our present MIM reveals the preponderance of specific biological functions over unspecific isomorphic behaviors. This is perhaps the consequence of hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.",

As Attouch et al. recently proved, an alternating proximal scheme ensures better convergence properties than the simpler alternating minimization. We take care of the issue of inexactness in the computation of the involved proximity operators, giving a sound stopping criterion for the dual inner algorithm, which keeps under control the related errors, unavoidable for such a complex penalty terms, providing ultimately an overall effective procedure.

Participants One hundred and ninety-eight consecutive patients with choroidal or ciliary body melanoma treated by PBT were retrospectively considered. Methods The post-PBT follow-up included ophthalmologic examination, retinography, and B and A modes of standardized echography every 6 months. A total of 1393 examinations were performed. We take into account 4 tumour categories according to the seventh TNM classification. Results Before PBT, tumour thickness ranged from 1.5 to 12.5 mm with a mean of 5.9 mm. Its decrease after radiotherapy was best fitted by the sum of a first-order exponential decay and a constant with a decay half-life of 15 months. Based on the fit, tumour thickness stabilized on a constant value representing, on average, 47% of the initial value. Mean internal reflectivity before PBT was 68%. The dynamics of the reflectivity were best fitted by an exponential and a constant, with rise half-life of 11 months, and stability value of 87%. Conclusions We found that ultrasonographic dynamics of uveal melanoma treated by PBT resembles a function composed of the sum of a constant and a first-order exponential, as previously noted in studies on brachytherapy. Interestingly, after PBT, because of its shorter half-life, internal reflectivity has a faster dynamic response than thickness in large tumours, suggesting that increase of internal reflectivity is a more sensitive indicator of early response to therapy in larger tumours.

Participants Cent quatre-vingt-dix-huit patients consécutifs atteints d’un mélanome choroïdien ou du corps ciliaire et ayant reçu une TFP ont été considérés. Méthodes Après la TFP, le suivi a compris l’examen ophtalmologique, la rétinographie et les modes A et B d’échographie standardisée aux 6 mois. En tout, 1 393 examens ont été effectués. Nous avons tenu compte de quatre catégories de tumeur selon la septième classification TNM. Résultats Avant la TFP, l’épaisseur des tumeurs variait entre 1,5 et 12,5 mm, avec une moyenne de 5,9 mm. Sa réduction après la radiothérapie a eu la meilleure concordance avec la somme d’une décroissance exponentielle de premier ordre et d’une constante ayant une demi-vie de décroissance de 15 mois. Selon les critères, l’épaisseur de la tumeur s’est stabilisée sur une valeur constante représentant en moyenne 47 % de la valeur initiale. La moyenne de réflectivité interne avant la TFP était de 68 %. La dynamique de la réflectivité concordait le mieux à une valeur exponentielle et constante, avec une hausse de demi-vie de 11 mois et une stabilité de 87 %. Conclusions Nous avons trouvé que la dynamique ultrasonographique du mélanome uvéal traité par la TFP ressemble à une fonction composée de la somme d’une constante et d’un exponentiel de premier ordre, tel que mentionné précédemment dans les études sur la brachythérapie. Fait intéressant, après la TFP, étant donné sa demi-vie plus courte, la réflectivité interne a une réponse dynamique plus rapide que l’épaisseur d’une grande tumeur, ce qui suggère que l’accroissement de la réflectivité interne est un indicateur plus sensible de la rapidité de la réaction à la thérapie des plus grandes tumeurs.",

A statistically significant correlation existed between the clinical outcome and the age of the horse. CONCLUSION: Treatment with platelet-derived growth factors leads to the formation of a tendon with normal morphology and functionality, which translate in the resumption of the agonistic activity for the horses we treated.","Animals, Horse Diseases, Horses, platelet, platelet-concentrate, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, Platelet-Rich Plasma, Regenerative medicine, Regenerative Medicine, regenerative surgery, teno-desmic injuries, tissue regeneration, Treatment Outcome, Ultrasonography, Wounds and Injuries"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients undergoing superficial parotidectomy were randomized and assigned to two groups, one with and one without PRP gel. Many parameters were evaluated after surgery and during follow-up, such as the duration of hospitalization, facial nerve deficit, onset of Frey's syndrome, relapse, cosmetic results, presence of keloid or scar depressions, behavior of several facial muscles. RESULTS: Our explorative analysis suggests a positive effect of PRP on surgical outcome in patients undergoing parotidectomy, whereas no negative effects were detected.

Methods For each DCE-MRI acquisition, after a spatial registration phase, the time-varying intensity of each voxel is represented as a sparse linear combination of adaptive basis signals. Both the basis signals and the sparse coefficients are learned by minimizing a functional consisting of a data fidelity term and a sparsity inducing penalty. Tissue segmentation is then obtained by applying a standard clustering algorithm to the computed representation. Results Quantitative estimates on two real data sets are presented. In the first case, the overlap with expert annotation measured with the DICE metric is nearly 90% and thus 5% more accurate than state-of-the-art techniques. In the second case, assessment of the correlation between quantitative scores, obtained by the proposed method against imagery manually annotated by two experts, achieved a Pearson coefficient of 0.83 and 0.87, and a Spearman coefficient of 0.83 and 0.71, respectively. Conclusions The sparse representation of DCE MRI signals obtained by means of adaptive dictionary learning techniques appears to be well-suited for unsupervised tissue segmentation and applicable to different clinical contexts with little effort.","Dictionary learning, Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, Sparse adaptive representation, Unsupervised tissue segmentation"

The issue of speaker variability is central to this problem, as changes in accent, dialect, gender, and age alter the sound waveform of speech units at multiple levels (phonemes, words, or phrases). Approaches for dealing with this variability have typically focused on analyzing the spectral properties of speech at the level of frames, on par with frame-level acoustic modeling usually applied to speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for representing speech at the word level and extracting features from the acoustic, temporal domain, without the need for spectral encoding or preprocessing. Leveraging recent work on unsupervised learning of invariant sensory representations, we extract a signature for a word by ﬁrst projecting its raw waveform onto a set of templates and their transformations, and then forming empirical estimates of the resulting one-dimensional distributions via histograms. The representation and relevant parameters are evaluated for word classiﬁcation on a series of datasets with increasing speakermismatch difﬁculty, and the results are compared to those of an MFCC-based representation.",

In this paper we present a machine learning approach to derive the input-output function of the olfactory-limbic pathway in the in vitro whole brain of guinea pig, less complex and more controllable than an in vivo system. We first experimentally characterized the neuronal pathway by delivering different sets of electrical stimuli from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and by recording the corresponding responses in the lateral entorhinal cortex (l-ERC). As a second step, we used information theory to evaluate how much information output features carry about the input. Finally we used the acquired data to learn the LOT-l-ERC “I/O function,” by means of the kernel regularized least squares method, able to predict l-ERC responses on the basis of LOT stimulation features. Our modeling approach can be further exploited for brain prostheses applications.",

We tackle this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can be efﬁciently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum.",

In this paper we propose a discriminative approach for learning an optimum set of templates, under a family of transformations, namely frequency transpositions and perturbations of the vocal tract length, which are among the primary sources of speech variability. Implicitly, we generalize convolutional networks to transformations other than translations, and derive data-speciﬁc templates by training a deep network with convolution-pooling layers and densely connected layers.

In the classical case with two marginals, this happens when the cost is positive, continuous, and possibly infinite and the first marginal has no atoms. We study a similar multimarginal symmetric problem, arising naturally in density functional theory, motivated by a recent paper by Buttazzo, De Pascale, and Gori Giorgi. The cost is the potential interaction between n charged particles (hence, it is symmetric, positive, continuous, and infinite whenever $$x_i=x_j$$), and the marginals are all equal with no atoms. We prove that also in this case, there is equality between the infimum in the cyclical Monge problem (the natural Monge problem in this context) and in the classical Kantorovich problem. This result is new even for 2 marginals, because we consider only transport maps which are involutions. The result is generalized to every symmetric continuous cost function on a Polish space.",

The obtained model is based on dictionaries which we learn and keep up to date as new data are provided by a video camera. We observe that, without dynamic events, video frames may be seen as noisy data belonging to the background. Over time, such background is subject to local and global changes due to variable illumination conditions, camera jitter, stable scene changes, and intermittent motion of background objects. To capture the locality of some changes, we propose a space-variant analysis where we learn a dictionary of atoms for each image patch, the size of which depends on the background variability. At run time, each patch is represented by a linear combination of the atoms learnt online. A change is detected when the atoms are not sufficient to provide an appropriate representation, and stable changes over time trigger an update of the current dictionary. Even if the overall procedure is carried out at a coarse level, a pixel-wise segmentation can be obtained by comparing the atoms with the patch corresponding to the dynamic event. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that the proposed method achieves very good performances on a variety of scenarios.

Our goal is to select groups of features meaningful to all classes simultaneously, and to this purpose we derive a new formulation of Group LASSO – the MC-GrpLASSO – and a solution of the obtained functional based on proximal methods. We then apply the algorithm to a typical multi-class problem – face recognition. On this respect we focus on finding an effective and fast to compute (that is, sparse) representation of faces, detected in low quality videos of unconstrained environments. We start from a classical over-complete representation based on Local Binary Patterns (LBPs), descriptors endowed with a characteristic internal structure that can be preserved by selecting features in groups. We present an extensive experimental analysis on two benchmark datasets, MOBO and Choke Point, and on a more complex set of data acquired in-house over a large temporal span. We compare our results with state-of-the-art approaches and show the superiority of our method in terms of both performances and sparseness of the obtained solution.","Face recognition, Group LASSO, Multi-class structured feature selection"

The method uses Gaussian process (GPs) classification to efficiently sample the surface of the object in order to reconstruct its shape. The proposed method iteratively samples the surface of the object, while, simultaneously constructing a probabilistic model of the object's surface. The probabilities in the model are used to guide the exploration. At each iteration, the estimate of the object's shape is used to slice the object in equally spaced intervals along the height of the object. The sampled locations are then labelled according to the interval in which their height falls. In its simple form, the data are labelled as belonging to the object and not belonging to the object: object and no-object, respectively. A GP classifier is trained to learn the object/no-object decision boundary. The next location to be sampled is selected at the classification boundary, in this way, the exploration is biased towards more informative areas. Complex features of the object's surface is captured by increasing the number of intervals as the number of sampled locations is increased. We validated our approach on six objects of different shapes using the iCub humanoid robot. Our experiments show that the method outperforms random selection and previous work based on GP regression by sampling more points on and near-the-boundary of the object.","Shape, Three-dimensional displays, Robots, Gaussian processes, Probabilistic logic, Surface reconstruction, Surface treatment"

Three-dimensional motion data of full-body movements are obtained either from professional optical motion-capture systems (Qualisys) or from low-cost RGB-D sensors (Kinect and Kinect2). A number of features are then automatically extracted at different levels, from kinematics of a single joint to more global expressive features inspired by psychology and humanistic theories (e.g., contraction index, fluidity, and impulsiveness). An abstraction layer based on dictionary learning further processes these movement features to increase the model generality and to deal with intraclass variability, noise, and incomplete information characterizing emotion expression in human movement. The resulting feature vector is the input for a classifier performing real-time automatic emotion recognition based on linear support vector machines. The recognition performance of the proposed model is presented and discussed, including the tradeoff between precision of the tracking measures (we compare the Kinect RGB-D sensor and the Qualisys motion-capture system) versus dimension of the training dataset. The resulting model and system have been successfully applied in the development of serious games for helping autistic children learn to recognize and express emotions by means of their full-body movement.","dictionary learning, automatic emotion recognition, Body, motion capture"

Most current methods of human detection from video analysis rely on appearance or shape features, thus exhibiting severe limitations as clutter or scene complexity grow, for instance when humans are using tools. We propose a way to overcome these limitations by exploiting a motionbased human detection system relying on the regularities of human kinematics. Our method, which is implemented as an open-source software module and integrated in the humanoid robot iCub software framework, extracts relevant features of biological motion in a computationally efficient way and feeds them to the attentional system of the robot. As a result the robot can rapidly direct its attention toward the human agents in the scene, even when they are hidden or partially covered by the tools they are using. The paper describes in detail the software framework supporting the autonomous learning of a discrimination policy between biological and non-biological motion observed in a scene. Then, it provides a quantitative validation of the classification performances on a batch dataset acquired by the iCub cameras and in a scenario where both training and classification are performed online. Last, it presents experiments on the integration of the module with the iCub attention system, demonstrating the ability of the robot to selectively and rapidly redeploy its fixation point on the human activity in the scene. The experimental results show that the proposed system can reliably enable the robot to focus its attention on human activity, a fundamental first step to allow for a deeper understanding of the observed action and a careful planning of an interaction strategy with a human partner.","Feature extraction, Humanoid robots, Robot sensing systems, Biology, Software"

One of the main challenges in this setting is to understand the role of different sensory modalities (namely proprioception, object weight from F/T sensors and touch) and how to combine them to correctly discriminate different objects. We investigated these aspects by considering multiple sensory channels and different exploratory strategies to gather meaningful information regarding the object's physical properties. We propose a novel strategy to train a learning machine able to efficiently combine sensory modalities by first learning individual object features and then combine them in a single classifier. To evaluate our approach and compare it with previous methods we collected a dataset for haptic object recognition, comprising 11 objects that were held in the hands of the iCub robot while performing different exploration strategies. Results show that our strategy consistently outperforms previous approaches [17].","Robot sensing systems, Object recognition, Force, Haptic interfaces, Thumb"

The square integrable representations of the shearlet groups provide not only the basis for the shearlet transforms but also for a very natural definition of scales of smoothness spaces, called shearlet coorbit spaces. The aim of this paper is twofold: first we discover isomorphisms between shearlet groups and other well-known groups, namely extended Heisenberg groups and subgroups of the symplectic group. Interestingly, the connected shearlet group with positive dilations has an isomorphic copy in the symplectic group, while this is not true for the full shearlet group with all nonzero dilations. Indeed we prove the general result that there exist, up to adjoint action of the symplectic group, only one embedding of the extended Heisenberg algebra into the Lie algebra of the symplectic group. Having understood the various group isomorphisms it is natural to ask for the relations between coorbit spaces of isomorphic groups with equivalent representations. These connections are examined in the second part of the paper. We describe how isomorphic groups with equivalent representations lead to isomorphic coorbit spaces. In particular we apply this result to square integrable representations of the connected shearlet groups and metaplectic representations of subgroups of the symplectic group. This implies the definition of metaplectic coorbit spaces. Besides the usual full and connected shearlet groups we also deal with Toeplitz shearlet groups.",

The text detection pipeline is based on a rather standard segmentation followed by a classification of each segmented connected component. Segmentation is performed by a linear implementation of MSER, state-of-the-art for text detection, where we control the overall computational cost of the method by computing a set of descriptive features as segmentation goes on. Classification is carried out by a cascade of SVM classifiers, where each layer captures different levels of complexity by means of an appropriate choice of descriptive features and kernel functions. Each detected text element, or character, is finally merged into lines of text and words. Further on, each element can be fed to a multi-class classifier that performs character recognition—this functionality is currently under development. We report experiments aiming at assessing the appropriateness of the text detection procedure, in terms of both performance and speed, when running on both x86 and ARM processors.",

The monotonicity of the velocity field implies that the 2 2 -Wasserstein distance along two solutions is λ λ -contractive, which in particular implies uniqueness. In the case of diffusive models, we prove the uniqueness of a solution passing through the dual equation, where we use some well-known parabolic estimates to conclude an L 1 L1 -contraction property.

We propose an approach to this problem and describe the underlying theory, based on the unsupervised, automatic learning of a “good” representation for supervised learning, characterized by small sample complexity. We consider the case of visual object recognition, though the theory also applies to other domains like speech. The starting point is the conjecture, proved in specific cases, that image representations which are invariant to translation, scaling and other transformations can considerably reduce the sample complexity of learning. We prove that an invariant and selective signature can be computed for each image or image patch: the invariance can be exact in the case of group transformations and approximate under non-group transformations. A module performing filtering and pooling, like the simple and complex cells described by Hubel and Wiesel, can compute such signature. The theory offers novel unsupervised learning algorithms for “deep” architectures for image and speech recognition. We conjecture that the main computational goal of the ventral stream of visual cortex is to provide a hierarchical representation of new objects/images which is invariant to transformations, stable, and selective for recognition—and show how this representation may be continuously learned in an unsupervised way during development and visual experience.","Invariance, Convolutional networks, Cortex, Hierarchy"

The ability to collaborate is also a key challenge for today’s robotics, which could benefit from the design of computational models supporting the understanding of social intelligence for the future of human robot interaction. Our research focuses on these topics from the perspective of computational vision. In particular we aim at understanding how social intelligence develops in presence of the very limited sensory-motor skills and prior knowledge common to babies. As a starting point we consider the natural predisposition of newborns to notice potential interacting partners in their surroundings, which is manifested by a preference for biological motion over other types of motion. To model this skill, we propose a video-based computational method for biological motion detection inspired by the Two-Thirds Power Law, a well-known invariant of human movements. In particular, we address the problem by recruiting machine learning framework, leveraging a binary classification to discriminate biological from non-biological stimuli from rather coarse motion models extracted from video measurements. After evaluating the performance of the method and its generalization power to complex scenarios in an offline test, the method is engineered to work online on a robot, the humanoid iCub. The integration with the attentional module of the robot enables it to direct its gaze toward human activity in the scene. We posit that the possibility for a robotic system to orient the attention toward potential interacting agents, as a human infant would, represents one of the first stages of social intelligence, on top of which more complex skills, as action and intention understanding, could emerge.",

In spatial dimension n = 2, it is known that the number of critical points (where $${\nabla u=0}$$) is related to the number of oscillations of the boundary condition independently of the (positive) coefficient $${\sigma}$$. We show that the situation is different in dimension $${n\geq3}$$. More precisely, we obtain that for any fixed (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary condition for u on $${\partial X}$$, there exists an open set of smooth coefficients $${\sigma(x)}$$such that $${\nabla u}$$vanishes at least at one point in X. By using estimates related to the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions, the result is first obtained for a piecewise constant conductivity with infinite contrast, a problem of independent interest. A second step shows that the topology of the vector field $${\nabla u}$$on a subdomain is not modified for appropriate bounded, sufficiently high-contrast, smooth coefficients $${\sigma(x)}$$. These results find applications in the class of hybrid inverse problems, where optimal stability estimates for parameter reconstruction are obtained in the absence of critical points. Our results show that for any (finite number of) prescribed boundary conditions, there are coefficients $${\sigma(x)}$$for which the stability of the reconstructions will inevitably degrade.",

The analysis of CGM sensor data makes possible to observe a wide range of metrics, such as the glycemic variability during the day or the amount of time spent below or above certain glycemic thresholds. However, due to the high variability of the glycemic signals among sensors and individuals, CGM data analysis is a non-trivial task. Standard signal filtering solutions fall short when an appropriate model personalization is not applied. State-of-the-art data-driven strategies for online CGM forecasting rely upon the use of recursive filters. Each time a new sample is collected, such models need to adjust their parameters in order to predict the next glycemic level.

In this framework our data are modeled as a partial Neumann-to-Dirichlet map (ND map). We compare this data to the full-boundary ND map and prove that the error depends linearly on the size of the missing part of the boundary. The same linear dependence is further proved for the difference of the reconstructed conductivities—from partial and full boundary data. The reconstruction is based on a truncated and linearized D-bar method.

The precocity of this ability suggests that it might be based on rather simple motion properties, and it can be interpreted as an atomic building block of more complex perception tasks typical of interacting scenarios, as the understanding of non-verbal communication cues based on motion or the anticipation of others’ action goals. In this article, we propose a novel perspective for video analysis, bridging cognitive science and machine vision, which leverages the use of computational models of the perceptual primitives that are at the basis of biological motion perception in humans.

In a first part, we propose an empirical formulation for the Two-Thirds Power Law, a well-known invariant law of human movement, and thoroughly discuss its readability in experimental settings of increasing complexity. In particular, we consider unconstrained video analysis scenarios, where, to the best of our knowledge, the invariant law has not found application so far.

Their adoption in robotics is challenging due to the cost associated with data acquisition and labeling. In this paper we focus on the problem of object detection, i.e. the simultaneous localization and recognition of objects in the scene, for which various DL architectures have been proposed in the literature. We propose to use an automatic annotation procedure, which leverages on human-robot interaction and depth-based segmentation, for the acquisition and labeling of training examples. We fine-tune the Faster R-CNN [36] network with these data acquired by the robot autonomously. We measure the performance on the same dataset and investigate the generalization abilities of the network on different settings and in absence of explicit segmentation, showing good detection performance. Experiments on the iCub humanoid robot [25] show that the proposed strategy is effective and can be used to deploy deep object detection algorithms on a robot.","Feature extraction, Training, Robot kinematics, Object detection, Computer architecture"

This puzzling set of findings begs for a general explanation grounded on an evolutionarily important computational function of the visual cortex. We show here that these properties are quantitatively predicted by the hypothesis that the goal of the ventral stream is to compute for each image a “signature” vector which is invariant to geometric transformations (Anselmi et al. 2013b). The mechanism for continuously learning and maintaining invariance may be the memory storage of a sequence of neural images of a few (arbitrary) objects via Hebbian synapses, while undergoing transformations such as translation, scale changes and rotation. For V1 simple cells this hypothesis implies that the tuning of neurons converges to the eigenvectors of the covariance of their input. Starting with a set of dendritic fields spanning a range of sizes, we show with simulations suggested by a direct analysis, that the solution of the associated “cortical equation” effectively provides a set of Gabor-like shapes with parameter values that quantitatively agree with the physiology data. The same theory provides predictions about the tuning of cells in V4 and in the face patch AL (Leibo et al. 2013a) which are in qualitative agreement with physiology data.","Deep Neural Network, Gabor Wavelet, Independent Component Analysis, Simple Cell, Visual Experience"

We shall consider sets that are locally well-approximated by k-dimensional planes, with k≪D, with k-dimensional manifolds isometrically embedded in RD being a special case. Samples from μ are furthermore corrupted by D-dimensional noise. Certain tools from multiscale geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis seem well-suited to be adapted to the study of samples from such probability distributions, in order to yield quantitative geometric information about them. In this paper we introduce and study multiscale covariance matrices, i.e. covariances corresponding to the distribution restricted to a ball of radius r, with a fixed center and varying r, and under rather general geometric assumptions we study how their empirical, noisy counterparts behave. We prove that in the range of scales where these covariance matrices are most informative, the empirical, noisy covariances are close to their expected, noiseless counterparts. In fact, this is true as soon as the number of samples in the balls where the covariance matrices are computed is linear in the intrinsic dimension of M. As an application, we present an algorithm for estimating the intrinsic dimension of M.","Covariance matrix estimation, Geometric measure theory, Intrinsic dimension estimation, Manifold learning, Multiscale analysis, Multiscale singular values, Point cloud data"

This ability has been suggested to be the basis for identifying conspecifics from birth, hence representing a fundamental skill for the development of social interaction. Inspired by this, we propose a computational model to detect biological motion in video sequences acquired by the iCub humanoid robot, as a first step to improve its action understanding and interaction capabilities in a developmental perspective. We propose a temporal multi-resolution motion description which automatically copes with different dynamics and builds on top of low-level features that capture biological motion regularities. The starting point of the representation is the optical flow, a low-level measurement which simulates the limited amount of visual information available at birth. The description is evaluated in its capability to discriminate between biological and non-biological movements. We show how a temporal multi-resolution descriptor can effectively deal with dynamic events of variable temporal duration and complexity. Then we provide evidence that our approach guarantees a robust classification of biological versus non-biological video sequences, which generalizes to new scenarios, including new agents and new actions, also in presence of severe occlusions.","Kernel, Visualization, Videos, Video sequences, Biology, Dynamics, Pediatrics"

Specifically, visual recognition is a prerequisite to a large variety of tasks such as tracking, manipulation, human–robot interaction. As a consequence, the lack of successful recognition often becomes a bottleneck for the application of robotics system to real-world situations. In this paper we aim at improving the robot visual perception capabilities in a natural, human-like fashion, with a very limited amount of constraints to the acquisition scenario. In particular our goal is to build and analyze a learning system that can rapidly be re-trained in order to incorporate new evidence if available. To this purpose, we review the state-of-the-art coding–pooling pipelines for visual recognition and propose two modifications which allow us to improve the quality of the representation, while maintaining real-time performances: a coding scheme, Best Code Entries (BCE), and a new pooling operator, Mid-Level Classification Weights (MLCW). The former focuses entirely on sparsity and improves the stability and computational efficiency of the coding phase, the latter increases the discriminability of the visual representation, and therefore the overall recognition accuracy of the system, by exploiting data supervision. The proposed pipeline is assessed from a qualitative perspective on a Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) application on the iCub platform. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is performed both on in-house robotics data-sets (iCubWorld) and on established computer vision benchmarks (Caltech-256, PASCAL VOC 2007).

The estimation of the contribution of the latent factors is embedded in the model which produces both sparse and low-rank components for each time point. In particular, the first component represents the connectivity structure of observable variables of the system, while the second represents the influence of hidden factors, assumed to be few with respect to the observed variables.

For a finer localization of the epileptogenic areas and a deeper understanding of the pathology both the identification of pathogenical biomarkers and the automatic characterization of epileptic signals are desirable. In this work we present a data integration learning method based on multi-level representation of stereo-electroencephalography recordings and multiple kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle both aspects simultaneously, as our approach is devised to classify critical vs. non-critical recordings while detecting the most discriminative frequency bands. The learning pipeline is applied to a data set of 18 patients for a total of 2347 neural recordings analyzed by medical experts. Without any prior knowledge assumption, the data-driven method reveals the most discriminative frequency bands for the localization of epileptic areas in the high-frequency spectrum (>= 80 Hz) while showing high performance metric scores (mean balanced accuracy of 0.89+-0.03). The promising results may represent a starting point for the automatic search of clinical biomarkers of epileptogenicity.",

We translate the coffee drop effect to model lichen growth and demonstrate that growth patterns follow directly from the diffusion of carbon dioxide in the air around a lichen. When a lichen is small, carbon dioxide is fixed across its surface, and the entire thallus contributes to radial growth, but when a lichen is larger carbon dioxide is disproportionately fixed at the edges of an individual, which are the primary drivers of growth.

Indeed, our study highlights how different parameters, such as number of features, iterations, step-size and mini-batch size control the learning properties of the solutions. We do this by deriving optimal finite sample bounds, under standard assumptions.

This book is designed for a graduate audience, interested in inverse problems and partial differential equations, and we have tried to make it as self-contained as possible. The analysis of hybrid imaging problems relies on several areas of the theory of PDE together with tools often used to study inverse problems. The full description of the models involved, from the theoretical foundations to the most current developments would require several volumes, and is beyond the scope of these notes, which we designed of a size commensurate with a twenty hours lecture course, the original format of the course. The presentation is limited to simplified settings, so that complete results could be explained entirely. This allows us to provide a proper course, instead of a survey of current research, but it comes at the price that more advanced results are not presented. We tried to give references to some of the major seminal papers in the area, in the hope that the interested reader would then follow these trails to the most current advances by means of usual bibliographical reference libraries. The physical model most often encountered in this book is the system of linear Maxwell’s equations. It is of foremost importance in the physics of inverse electromagnetic problems. Compared to the conductivity equation and the Helmholtz equation, the analysis of Maxwell’s equations is much less developed, and these lectures contain several new results, which have been established while writing this book. In the chapter discussing regularity properties we focus on the Maxwell system’s of equations in the time harmonic case. Proofs regarding small volume inhomogeneities are given for the Maxwell’s system as well. We introduce the inverse source problem from time-dependent boundary measurements for the wave equation from the classical control theory point of view, leaving aside many deep results related to the geometric control of the wave equation or the Radon transform, or recent developments concerning randomised data. Probabilistic methods are not used, random media are not considered, compressed sensing and other image processing approaches are not mentioned. All these questions would certainly be perfectly natural in this course, but would require a different set of authors. For many of these questions, we refer the reader to the relevant chapters of the Handbook of Mathematical Methods in Imaging [Sch15] for detailed introductions and references.

In humans, NK cells may be divided in various subsets on the basis of the relative CD56 expression and of the low-affinity FcγRIIIA CD16. In particular, the two main NK cell subsets are represented by the CD56bright/CD16−/dim and the CD56dim/CD16bright NK cells. Experimental evidences indicate that CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells represent different maturative stages of the NK cell developmental pathway. We identified multiple miRNAs differentially expressed in CD56bright/CD16− and CD56dim/CD16bright NK cells using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Among these, we found a few miRNAs with a consistent differential expression in the two NK cell subsets, and with an intermediate expression in the CD56bright/CD16dim NK cell subset, representing a transitional step of maturation of NK cells. These analyses allowed us to establish the existence of a miRNA signature able to efficiently discriminate the two main NK cell subsets regardless of their surface phenotype. In addition, by analyzing the putative targets of representative miRNAs we show that hsa-miR-146a-5p, may be involved in the regulation of killer Ig-like receptor (KIR) expression. These results contribute to a better understanding of the physiologic significance of miRNAs in the regulation of the development/function of human NK cells. Moreover, our results suggest that hsa-miR-146a-5p targeting, resulting in KIR down-regulation, may be exploited to generate/increment the effect of NK KIR-mismatching against HLA-class I+ tumor cells and thus improve the NK-mediated anti-tumor activity.",

In such context, the main results establish a new general form of the representer theorem and the consistency of the corresponding learning schemes under general conditions on the loss function, the geometry of the feature space, and the modulus of total convexity of the regularizer.

The penalty is a sparsity inducing one, promoting solutions depending only on a small subset of the features. The group lasso problem is a special case of this more general setting. We show that one of the most popular optimization algorithms to solve the regularized objective function, the forward-backward splitting method, allows to perform feature selection in a stable manner.

Proposed approaches are based on end-to-end learning by back-propagation [22] or kernel methods trained with Hard Negatives Mining on top of deep features [8].

We model such instants as local minima of the movement velocity profile and mark temporal locations that are preserved under projective transformations, i.e. that resist to the mapping on the image planes and then can be considered view-invariant. Also, their level of generality allows them to easily adapt to a variety of human dynamics and settings. We first validate a computational method to detect such instants offline, on a new dataset of cooking activities. Then we propose an online implementation of the method, and we integrate the new functionality in the software framework of the iCub humanoid robot.

We developed a pipeline that extracts the dataset from raw data and performs the analysis returning the signatures and their relative usage frequencies. A thorough comparison between our method and the state of the art procedure reveals that our pipeline can be used alternatively without losing information and possibly gaining more interpretability and precision.","Dictionary learning, Mutational signatures, Somatic mutations, Sparsity"

Among them, a well-known scheme is to use Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. While various remarkable results have been reported, skill learning with physical constraints has not been sufficiently investigated. For example, when RL is employed to optimize the robot joint trajectories, the exploration noise could drive the resulting trajectory out of the joint limits. In this paper, we focus on robot skill learning characterized by joint limit avoidance, by introducing the novel Constrained Dynamic Movement Primitives (CDMPs). By controlling a set of transformed states (called exogenous states) instead of the original DMPs states, CDMPs are capable of maintaining the joint trajectories within the safety limits. We validate CDMPs on the humanoid robot iCub, showing the applicability of our approach.","Shape, Humanoid robots, Trajectory, Aerospace electronics, Collision avoidance, Heuristic algorithms"

This clinical picture occurs during the evolution of peritoneal tumors, and it is the main cause of morbidity and mortality of patients affected by these pathologies, though cytoreductive surgery with heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) is yielding promising results. In the present study, we evaluated whether the tumor microenvironment of low-grade and high-grade PC could affect the phenotypic and functional features and thus the anti-tumor potential of NK cells. We show that while in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of low-grade PC most CD56dim NK cells show a relatively immature phenotype (NKG2A+KIR–CD57–CD16dim), in the PF of high-grade PC NK cells are, in large majority, mature (CD56dimKIR+CD57+CD16bright). Furthermore, in low-grade PC, PF-NK cells are characterized by a sharp down-regulation of some activating receptors, primarily NKp30 and DNAM-1, while, in high-grade PC, PF-NK cells display a higher expression of the PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint. The compromised phenotype observed in low-grade PC patients corresponds to a functional impairment. On the other hand, in the high-grade PC patients PF-NK cells show much more important defects that only partially reflect the compromised phenotype detected. These data suggest that the PC microenvironment may contribute to tumor escape from immune surveillance by inducing different NK cell impaired features leading to altered anti-tumor activity. Notably, after CRS/HIPEC treatment, the altered NK cell phenotype of a patient with a low-grade disease and favorable prognosis was reverted to a normal one. Our present data offer a clue for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies capable of restoring the NK-mediated anti-tumor responses in association with the CRS/HIPEC treatment to increase the effectiveness of the current therapy.",

In some cases, these alterations are so linked with the aging process that it is possible predict the age of a person on the basis of the modification of one specific pathway, as proposed by Horwath and his aging clock based on DNA methylation. Because the energy metabolism changes are involved in the aging process, in this work, we propose a new aging clock based on the modifications of glucose catabolism. The biochemical analyses were performed on mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood, obtained from a healthy population with an age between 5 and 106 years. In particular, we have evaluated the oxidative phosphorylation function and efficiency, the ATP/AMP ratio, the lactate dehydrogenase activity and the malondialdehyde content. Further, based on these biochemical markers, we developed a machine learning-based mathematical model able to predict the age of an individual with a mean absolute error of approximately 9.7 years. This mathematical model represents a new non-invasive tool to evaluate and define the age of individuals and could be used to evaluate the effects of drugs or other treatments on the early aging or the rejuvenation.","Biogeochemistry, Predictive markers"

In this paper we propose a fully dynamical method based on a phase-space lifting of the positions and the velocities of the particles, which are simultaneously reconstructed with superresolution. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the recovery problem, both for the noiseless case and in the presence of noise (in the discrete setting).

This has a big impact since nowadays our society relies on (potentially) unreliable applications that could cause, in extreme cases, catastrophic events (e.g., loss of life due to a wrong diagnosis of an ML-based cancer classifier). In this paper, as a preliminary step towards providing a solution to this big problem, we used automatic mutations to mimic realistic bugs in the code of two machine learning algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron and Logistic Regression, with the goal of studying the impact of implementation bugs on their behaviours. Unexpectedly, our experiments show that about 2/3 of the injected bugs are silent since they does not influence the results of the algorithms, while the bugs emerge as runtime errors, exceptions, or modified accuracy of the predictions only in the remaining cases. Moreover, we also discovered that about 1% of the bugs are extremely dangerous since they drastically affect the quality of the prediction only in rare cases and with specific datasets increasing the possibility of going unnoticed.","machine learning, accuracy, bug, Oracle problem, software quality assurance, testing"

Since they will be working closely with human operators not always properly trained for human-machine interaction tasks, robots will need the ability of automatically adapting to changes in the task to be performed or to cope with variations in how the human partner completes the task. The goal of this work is to make a further step toward endowing robot with such capability. To this purpose, we focus on the identification of relevant time instants in an observed action, called dynamic instants, informative on the partner's movement timing, and marking instants where an action starts or ends, or changes to another action. The time instants are temporal locations where the motion can be ideally segmented, providing a set of primitives that can be used to build a temporal signature of the action and finally support the understanding of the dynamics and coordination in time. We validate our approach in two contexts, considering first a situation in which the human partner can perform multiple different activities, and then moving to settings where an action is already recognized and shows a certain degree of periodicity. In the two contexts we address different challenges. In the first one, working in batch on a dataset collecting videos of a variety of cooking activities, we investigate whether the action signature we compute could facilitate the understanding of which type of action is occurring in front of the observer, with tolerance to viewpoint changes. In the second context, we evaluate online on the robot iCub the capability of the action signature in providing hints to establish an actual temporal coordination during the interaction with human participants. In both cases, we show promising results that speak in favor of the potentiality of our approach.",

How is it possible that training performance is independent of testing performance? Do indeed deep networks require a drastically new theory of generalization?

How the growth rate and direction depend on the material properties provide indications of the internal behaviour and response of the organism to its environment. These can be better understood by growing filaments in controlled substrates, and even reducing experiments to observing the penetration of thin solids in soft materials.

This is attributed to a delay in the arrangement of home-care assistance or in admission to long-term care facilities. Recently a lot of technologies have been developed to improve caring and monitoring of older people. The aim of this study is to design, implement and test a prototype of a technology based post-hospitalization facility for older people at risk of DHD by using domotics, robotics and wearable sensors for tele-monitoring. A sensorised posthospitalization facility has been built inside the hospital. Thirty-five healthy volunteers aged from 20 to 82 years were recruited. Clinical and functional assessment, ie motility index (MI), and human-robot interaction satisfaction were measured. A significant correlation was observed between automatic MI and the Gait Speed, the time sit-to-stand, and the Timed Up and Go test. Domotics, robotics and technology-based telemonitoring may represent a new way to assess patient’s autonomy and functional and clinical conditions in an ecological way, reproducing as much as possible a real life at home.",

However, over the course of the disease metformin may fail to achieve appropriate glycemic control, and a second-line therapy may become necessary. In this paper we introduce Tangle, a time span-guided neural attention model that can accurately and timely predict the upcoming need for a second-line diabetes therapy from administrative data in the Australian adult population. The method is suitable for designing automatic therapy review recommendations for patients and their providers without the need to collect clinical measures. Data We analyzed seven years of de-identified records (2008-2014) of the 10% publicly available linked sample of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) electronic databases of Australia. Methods By design, Tangle inherits the representational power of pre-trained word embedding, such as GloVe, to encode sequences of claims with the related MBS codes. Moreover, the proposed attention mechanism natively exploits the information hidden in the time span between two successive claims (measured in number of days). We compared the proposed method against state-of-the-art sequence classification methods. Results Tangle outperforms state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks, including attention-based models. In particular, when the proposed time span-guided attention strategy is coupled with pre-trained embedding methods, the model performance reaches an Area Under the ROC Curve of 90%, an improvement of almost 10 percentage points over an attentionless recurrent architecture. Implementation Tangle is implemented in Python using Keras and it is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/samuelefiorini/tangle.","Machine learning, Deep learning, Semantics, Attention, Body weight, Diabetes mellitus, Medicare, Word embedding"

Here, we tested the hypothesis that additional mutations, though occurring in only a few cases (&ldquo;secondary drivers&rdquo;), might influence tumor development. Methods: We analyzed all the 4125 mutations detected in exome sequencing datasets, comprising a total of 139 Ums, and tested the enrichment of secondary drivers in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that also contained the initiating mutations. We searched for additional mutations in the putative secondary driver gene protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta (PTK2B) and we developed new mutational signatures that explain the mutational pattern observed in UM. Results: Secondary drivers were significantly enriched in KEGG pathways that also contained GNAQ and GNA11, such as the calcium-signaling pathway. Many of the secondary drivers were known cancer driver genes and were strongly associated with metastasis and survival. We identified additional mutations in PTK2B. Sparse dictionary learning allowed for the identification of mutational signatures specific for UM. Conclusions: A considerable part of rare mutations that occur in addition to known driver mutations are likely to affect tumor development and progression.","driver mutation, gene set enrichment, mutation signature, tumor evolution"

By reducing the analysis of generic group symmetries to permutation symmetries, we devise a regularization scheme for representation learning algorithm, using an unlabeled training set.

For the MoCap, we employ a representation based on the use of 3D+t histograms modelling the space-time evolution of an action, classified using a classical Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel. As for the videos, we learn the representation using a variant of the Inception 3D model, followed by a Single Layer Perceptron as a classifier.

Recent medical literature has proposed the notion of frail elderly, which rapidly became a key element of clinical practices for the estimation of well-being in aging population. The evaluation of frailty is commonly based on self reported outcomes and occasional physicians evaluations, leading to possibly biased results. In this work we propose a data driven method to automatically evaluate two of the main aspects contributing to the frailty estimation, i.e. the motility of the subject and his cognitive status. The first one is evaluated using visual computing tools, while the latter relies on a virtual reality based system. We provide an extensive experimental assessment performed on two sets of data acquired in a sensorised protected discharge facility located in a local hospital. Our results are in good agreement with the assessment manually performed by physicians, nicely showing the potential capability of our approach to complement current protocols of evaluation.","Aging, Cognitive assessment, Frailty, Frailty index, Motility index, Skeleton data, Virtual reality, Visual computing"

In this work, we focus on one of the most relevant topological properties that characterize the network, i.e. being scale-free. A directed network is scale-free if its in-degree and out-degree distributions have an approximate and asymptotic power-law behavior. If we consider the Web as a whole, it presents empirical evidence of such property. On the other hand, when we restrict the study of the degree distributions to specific sub-categories of websites, there is no longer strong evidence for it. For this reason, many works questioned the almost universal ubiquity of the scale-free property. Moreover, existing statistical methods to test whether an empirical degree distribution follows a power law suffer from large sample sizes and/or noisy data.In this paper, we propose an extension of a state-of-the-art method that overcomes such problems by applying a Monte Carlo sub-sampling procedure on the graphs. We show on synthetic experiments that even small variations of true power-law distributed data causes the state-of-the-art method to reject the hypothesis, while the proposed method is more sound and stable under such variations.Lastly, we perform a study on 3 websites showing that indeed, depending on their category, some accept and some refuse the hypothesis of being power-law.

In the present work, we investigate to which extent a computational model based on kinematics can determine action similarity and how its performance relates to human similarity judgments of the same actions. To this aim, twelve participants perform an action similarity task, and their performances are compared to that of a computational model solving the same task. The chosen model has its roots in developmental robotics and performs action classification based on learned kinematic primitives. The comparative experiment results show that both the model and human participants can reliably identify whether two actions are the same or not. However, the model produces more false hits and has a greater selection bias than human participants. A possible reason for this is the particular sensitivity of the model towards kinematic primitives of the presented actions. In a second experiment, human participants' performance on an action identification task indicated that they relied solely on kinematic information rather than on action semantics. The results show that both the model and human performance are highly accurate in an action similarity task based on kinematic-level features, which can provide an essential basis for classifying human actions.","Visualization, action primitives, Action similarity, biological motion, Biological system modeling, comparative study, computational model, Computational modeling, Dictionaries, Kinematics, Semantics, Task analysis"

A similar result for Calderón's problem is obtained as a corollary. This improves upon two previous results of the authors on several aspects, namely the number of measurements and the stability with respect to mismodeling errors. A new iterative reconstruction scheme based on the stability result is also presented, for which we prove exponential convergence in the number of iterations and stability with respect to noise in the data and to mismodeling errors.","35R30, Calderón problem, complex geometrical optics solutions, electrical impedance tomography, Gel'fand-Calderón problem, inverse conductivity problem, Lipschitz stability, local uniqueness, reconstruction algorithm"

For pharmacoresistant patients, the surgical resection of the critical area is considered a valid clinical solution, therefore, an accurate localization is crucial to minimize neurological damage. In current clinical routine the characterization of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) is performed using invasive methods, such as Stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG). Medical experts perform the tag of neural electrophysiological recordings by visually inspecting the acquired data, a highly time consuming and subjective procedure. Here we show the results of an automatic multi-modal classification method for the evaluation of critical areas in focal epileptic patients.

It is based on feeding electrical currents into the patient, measuring the resulting voltages at the skin, and recovering the internal conductivity distribution. The mathematical task of EIT image reconstruction is a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore any EIT image reconstruction method needs to be regularized, typically resulting in blurred images. One promising application is stroke-EIT, or classification of stroke into either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke involves a blood clot, preventing blood flow to a part of the brain causing a low-conductivity region. Hemorrhagic stroke means bleeding in the brain causing a high-conductivity region. In both cases the symptoms are identical, so a cost-effective and portable classification device is needed. Typical EIT images are not optimal for stroke-EIT because of blurriness. This paper explores the possibilities of machine learning in improving the classification results. Two paradigms are compared: (a) learning from the EIT data, that is Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps and (b) extracting robust features from data and learning from them. The features of choice are virtual hybrid edge detection (VHED) functions (Greenleaf et al 2018 Anal. PDE 11) that have a geometric interpretation and whose computation from EIT data does not involve calculating a full image of the conductivity. We report the measures of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the networks trained with EIT data and VHED functions separately. Computational evidence based on simulated noisy EIT data suggests that the regularized grey-box paradigm (b) leads to significantly better classification results than the black-box paradigm (a).",

Gaze direction provides some of the strongest indications of how a person interacts with the environment. In this paper, we propose a simple neural network regressor that estimates the gaze direction of individuals in a multi-camera assisted living scenario, relying only on the relative positions of facial keypoints collected from a single pose estimation model. To handle cases of keypoint occlusion, our model exploits a novel confidence gated unit in its input layer. In addition to the gaze direction, our model also outputs an estimation of its own prediction uncertainty. Experimental results on a public benchmark demonstrate that our approach performs on par with a complex, dataset-specific baseline, while its uncertainty predictions are highly correlated to the actual angular error of corresponding estimations. Finally, experiments on images from a real assisted living environment demonstrate that our model has a higher suitability for its final application.","Feature extraction, Predictive models, Task analysis, Assisted living, Estimation, Logic gates, Uncertainty"

Further, we optimize the numerical precision of different operations and maximize efficiency of matrix-vector multiplications.

While traditional imitation learning that only focuses on either Cartesian or joint space might become inappropriate in situations where both spaces are equally important (e.g., writing or striking task), hybrid imitation learning of skills in both Cartesian and joint spaces simultaneously has been studied recently. However, an important issue which often arises in dynamical or unstructured environments is overlooked, namely how can a robot avoid obstacles? In this paper, we aim to address the problem of avoiding obstacles in the context of hybrid imitation learning. Specifically, we propose to tackle three subproblems: (i) designing a proper potential field so as to bypass obstacles, (ii) guaranteeing joint limits are respected when adjusting trajectories in the process of avoiding obstacles, and (iii) determining proper control commands for robots such that potential human-robot interaction is safe. By solving the aforementioned subproblems, the robot is capable of generalizing observed skills to new situations featuring obstacles in a feasible and safe manner.

The tuning of hyper-parameters, in unsupervised settings, can be performed through criteria based on likelihood or stability. Likelihood-based scores can be easily generalised to the multi hyper-parameters setting, but their computation is feasible only under certain probability assumptions. Differently, stability-based methods are of general application and, on single hyper-parameter, they have been proved to outperform likelihood-based scores. In this work we present a multi-parameters extension to stability-based methods that can be easily applied on complex models.

Recently, artificial convolutional networks have succeeded in both learning such invariant properties and, surprisingly, predicting cortical responses in macaque and mouse visual cortex with unprecedented accuracy. However, some of the key ingredients that enable such success—supervised learning and the backpropagation algorithm—are neurally implausible. This makes it difficult to relate advances in understanding convolutional networks to the brain. In contrast, many of the existing neurally plausible theories of invariant representations in the brain involve unsupervised learning, and have been strongly tied to specific plasticity rules. To close this gap, we study an instantiation of simple-complex cell model and show, for a broad class of unsupervised learning rules (including Hebbian learning), that we can learn object representations that are invariant to nuisance transformations belonging to a finite orthogonal group. These findings may have implications for developing neurally plausible theories and models of how the visual cortex or artificial neural networks build selectivity for discriminating objects and invariance to real-world nuisance transformations.","Group theory, Hebbian learning, Invariance"

In the present study, we have used PDMS micro-fabrication to probe the ability of filamentous C. albicans cells to penetrate and grow invasively in substrates of different stiffness. We show that there is a threshold for penetration that corresponds to a stiffness of ~ 200 kPa and that invasive growth within a stiff substrate is characterized by dramatic filament buckling, along with a stiffness-dependent decrease in extension rate. We observed a striking alteration in cell morphology, i.e., reduced cell compartment length and increased diameter during invasive growth, that is not due to depolarization of active Cdc42, but rather occurs at a substantial distance from the site of growth as a result of mechanical compression. Our data reveal that in response to this compression, active Cdc42 levels are increased at the apex, whereas active Rho1 becomes depolarized, similar to that observed in membrane protrusions.

The latter is a natural nonlinear extension of classical PCA based on considering a nonlinear feature map or the corresponding kernel. Like other kernel approaches, kernel PCA enjoys good mathematical and statistical properties but, numerically, it scales poorly with the sample size. Our analysis shows that Nyström sampling greatly improves computational efficiency without incurring any loss of statistical accuracy. While similar effects have been observed in supervised learning, this is the first such result for PCA. Our theoretical findings are based on a combination of analytic and concentration of measure techniques. Our study is more broadly motivated by the question of understanding the interplay between statistical and computational requirements for learning.",

Therefore any EIT image reconstruction method needs to be regularized, typically resulting in blurred images. One promising application is stroke-EIT, or classification of stroke into either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke involves a blood clot, preventing blood flow to a part of the brain causing a low-conductivity region. Hemorrhagic stroke means bleeding in the brain causing a high-conductivity region. In both cases the symptoms are identical, so a cost-effective and portable classification device is needed.

As a consequence, the need of developing ad-hoc techniques that cope with such issue arises in many inference contexts. In this paper, we focus on the inference of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) from multiple input datasets having complex relationships (eg multi-class or temporal). We propose a method that generalises state-of-the-art approaches to the inference of both multi-class and temporal GGMs while naturally dealing with two types of missing data: partial and latent. Synthetic experiments show that our performance is better than state-of-the-art. In particular, we compared results with single network inference methods that suitably deal with missing data, and multiple joint network inference methods coupled with standard pre-processing techniques (eg imputing). When dealing with fully observed datasets our method analytically reduces to state-of-the-art approaches providing a good alternative as our implementation reaches convergence in shorter or comparable time. Finally, we show that properly addressing the missing data problem in a multi-class real-world example, allows us to discover interesting varying patterns.",

For example, in a biological setting, genes interact differently depending on external environmental or metabolic factors. To incorporate this dynamics a viable strategy is to estimate a sequence of temporally related graphs assuming similarity among samples in different time points. While adjacent time points may direct the analysis towards a robust estimate of the underlying graph, the resulting model will not incorporate long-term or recurrent temporal relationships. In this work we propose a dynamical network inference model that leverages on kernels to consider general temporal patterns (such as circadian rhythms or seasonality). We show how our approach may also be exploited when the recurrent patterns are , by coupling the network inference with a clustering procedure that detects possibly non-consecutive similar networks. Such clusters are then used to build similarity kernels. The convexity of the functional is determined by whether we impose or infer the kernel. In the first case, the optimisation algorithm exploits efficiently proximity operators with closed-form solutions. In the other case, we resort to an alternating minimisation procedure which jointly learns the temporal kernel and the underlying network. Extensive analysis on synthetic data shows the efficacy of our models compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we applied our approach on two realworld applications to show how considering long-term patterns is fundamental to have insights on the behaviour of a complex system.","Kernel, Data models, Analytical models, Graphical models, Inference algorithms, Market research, Minimization"

Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions:(1) most vs none of the viral content settles in the first 1-2 m;(2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei vs on liquid droplets;(3) small droplets travel less than 2.5 m vs more than 7.5 m. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules:(I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes;(I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei vs liquid droplets.

By means of state-of-the-art fully resolved direct numerical simulations we contribute to solve this issue by identifying the key role of turbulence on the fate of exhaled droplets.

Turbulent transport of droplets in a jet/puff is a problem of paramount importance in science and engineering that nowadays has become even more important given the global COVID-19 emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection; for a recent review see [1–3]. The relationship between COVID-19 and turbulent transport of droplets stems from the fact that the dominant route of SARS-CoV-2 spread is via small virus-containing respiratory droplets that the infected person exhales when coughing, sneezing or talking [4]. Different factors make the fate of liquid droplets hard to predict. The exhalation is far from a homogeneous fluid. It rather consists of a two-phase mixture of liquid droplets dispersed into a fluid phase which is usually at a higher temperature and humidity than the ambient air. Evaporation thus occurs making the droplets lighter (and less inertial) than they were at the expulsion stage. The exhaled air is also turbulent because of the large velocities reached during violent expiratory events. The Reynolds number is about 104 [5, 6] for cough and even …",

In particular, we consider the role played by the structure of the true regression parameter. We observe that the case of a general deterministic parameter can be reduced to the case of a random parameter from a structured prior. The latter assumption is a natural adaptation of classic smoothness assumptions in nonparametric regression, which are known as source conditions in the the context of regularization theory for inverse problems. Roughly speaking, we assume the large coefficients of the parameter are in correspondence to the principal components. In this setting a precise characterisation of the test error is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression parameter structure. We illustrate this characterisation in a simplified setting to investigate the influence of the true parameter on optimal regularisation for overparameterized models. We show that interpolation (no regularisation) can be optimal even with bounded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), provided that the parameter coefficients are larger on high-variance directions of the data, corresponding to a more regular function than posited by the regularization term. This contrasts with previous work considering ridge regression with isotropic prior, in which case interpolation is only optimal in the limit of infinite SNR.","ridge regression, prediction error, high-dimensional regime"

The main difficulty lies in constructing an efficient rule, allowing to compute the parameter from given noisy data without relying either on any a priori knowledge of the solution, noise level or on the manual input. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a statistical learning theory framework to approximate the high-dimensional function, which maps noisy data to the optimal Tikhonov regularization parameter. After an offline phase where we observe samples of the noisy data-to-optimal parameter mapping, an estimate of the optimal regularization parameter is computed directly from noisy data. Our assumptions are that ground truth solutions of the inverse problem are statistically distributed in a concentrated manner on (lower-dimensional) linear subspaces and the noise is sub-gaussian. We show that for our method to be efficient, the number of previously observed samples of the noisy data-to-optimal parameter mapping needs to scale at most linearly with the dimension of the solution subspace. We provide explicit error bounds on the approximation accuracy from noisy data of unobserved optimal regularization parameters and ground truth solutions. Even though the results are more of theoretical nature, we present a recipe for the practical implementation of the approach. We conclude with presenting numerical experiments verifying our theoretical results and illustrating the superiority of our method with respect to several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy or computational time for solving inverse problems of various types.","Tikhonov regularization,parameter choice rule,sub-gaussian vectors,high-dimensional function approximation,concentration inequalities"

Rainfall detection is a fundamental step of acoustical meteorology toward quantifying precipitation and, indirectly, wind. To date, this task has been conducted with some success by using a few frequency bins of the noise spectrum and combining their absolute values and slopes into some inequalities. Unfortunately, these algorithms do not perform well when applied to spectra obtained by averaging multiple noise recordings made over the course of an hour. Supervised, machine learning models allow the use of all the frequency bins in the spectrum, exploiting relationships that are difficult for a human observer to identify. Among the different models tested, a binary classifier based on random forest performed well with moderate computational load. Using a dataset consisting of over 18 000 hourly averaged spectra (approximately 25 months of in situ recordings) and comparing the results with measurements from a surface-mounted rain gauge, the proposed system detects precipitations greater than 1 mm/h with 90% probability, keeping the false alarm probability below 0.5%. This system has demonstrated remarkable robustness as performance is achieved without intentionally excluding any spectra corrupted by sounds produced by other sources, such as naval traffic and wind blowing over the sea surface.","Wind speed, Rain,Sea measurements,Machine learning, Acoustics,Acoustic measurements,Marine vehicles,Acoustical meteorology

Moreover, it allows to study the relation between continuous and discrete frames in a random sampling regime, where discrete frames can be seen as Monte Carlo estimates of the continuous ones. Pairing spectral regularization with learning theory, we show that a sample frame tends to its population counterpart, and derive explicit finite-sample rates on spaces of Sobolev and Besov regularity.

To test this hypothesis, we combine fully-resolved numerical simulations of turbulent odor transport and Bellman optimization methods for decision-making under partial observability. We show that an agent trained to minimize search time in a realistic odor plume exhibits extensive alternation together with the characteristic cast-and-surge behavior commonly observed in flying insects. Alternation is tightly linked with casting and occurs more frequently when the agent is far downwind of the source, where the likelihood of detecting airborne cues is higher relative to cues close to the ground. Casting and alternation emerge as complementary tools for effective exploration when cues are sparse.

Limitations in odor detection technology have made it impossible to measure plume fluctuations while simultaneously recording from the mouse’s brain.

Adequately sampling this feature space is difficult given a lack of knowledge regarding which features the brain extracts during exposure to natural olfactory scenes.

The clustering divides the time points into stationary sub-groups whose underlying distribution can be inferred through a graphical model. Such coupling can be further exploited to build a time-varying regression model which allows to both make predictions and obtain insights on the presence of causal patterns. We extensively validate the proposed approach on synthetic data showing that it has better performance than the …","Computing methodologies,Machine learning, Learning latent representations,Mathematics of computing,Probability and statistics,Probabilistic representations,Markov networks,Theory of computation,Theory and algorithms for application domains,Machine learning theory,Structured prediction,Unsupervised learning, clustering"

For example, in a biological setting, genes interact differently depending on external environmental or metabolic factors. To incorporate this dynamics a viable strategy is to estimate a sequence of temporally related graphs assuming similarity among samples in different time points. While adjacent time points may direct the analysis towards a robust estimate of the underlying graph, the resulting model will not incorporate long-term or recurrent temporal relationships. In this work we propose a dynamical network inference model that leverages on kernels to consider general temporal patterns (such as circadian rhythms or seasonality). We show how our approach may also be exploited when the recurrent patterns are , by coupling the network inference with a clustering procedure that detects possibly non-consecutive similar networks. Such clusters are then used to build similarity kernels. The convexity of the functional is determined by whether we impose or infer the kernel. In the first case, the optimisation algorithm exploits efficiently proximity operators with closed-form solutions. In the other case, we resort to an alternating minimisation procedure which jointly learns the temporal kernel and the underlying network. Extensive analysis on synthetic data shows the efficacy of our models compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, whether intensity or timing of odor detections is more informative for olfactory-driven behavior is not understood. To tackle this question, we consider the problem of locating a target using the odor it releases. We ask whether the position of a target is best predicted by measures of timing intensity of its odor, sampled for a short period of time. To answer this question, we feed data from accurate numerical simulations of odor transport to machine learning algorithms that learn how to connect odor to target location. We find that both intensity and timing can separately predict target location even from a distance of several meters; however their efficacy varies with the dilution of the odor in space. Thus organisms that use olfaction from different ranges may have to switch among different modalities. This has implications on how the brain should represent odors as the target is approached. We demonstrate simple strategies to improve accuracy and robustness of the prediction by modifying odor sampling and appropriately combining distinct measures together. To test the predictions, animal behavior and odor representation should be monitored as the animal moves relative to the target, or in virtual conditions that mimic concentrated dilute environments.",

A reformulation of the same GP posterior highlights that this complexity mainly depends on how many \emph{unique} historical points are considered. This can have important implication in active learning settings, where the set of historical points is constructed sequentially by the learner. We show that sequential black-box optimization based on GPs (GP-Opt) can be made efficient by sticking to a candidate solution for multiple evaluation steps and switch only when necessary. Limiting the number of switches also limits the number of unique points in the history of the GP. Thus, the efficient GP reformulation can be used to exactly and cheaply compute the posteriors required to run the GP-Opt algorithms. This approach is especially useful in real-world applications of GP-Opt with high switch costs (e.g. switching chemicals in wet labs, data/model loading in hyperparameter optimization). As examples of this meta-approach, we modify two well-established GP-Opt algorithms, GP-UCB and GP-EI, to switch candidates as infrequently as possible adapting rules from batched GP-Opt. These versions preserve all the theoretical no-regret guarantees while improving practical aspects of the algorithms such as runtime, memory complexity, and the ability of batching candidates and evaluating them in parallel.",

Moreover, other 3D perception tasks (such as depth estimation) have shown the benefits of temporal priors as a self-supervision signal. In this work, we argue that the temporal consistency on the level of object poses, provides an important supervision signal given the strong prior on physical motion. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised loss which uses this consistency, in addition to render-and-compare losses, to refine noisy pose predictions and derive high-quality pseudo labels.

We then used an unsupervised learning approach to cluster the vacuole types and to establish a correlation between genotype and vacuole morphology. Using this procedure, we obtained 4 phenotypic groups. We extracted a set of 131 morphological features from the segmented vacuoles images, reduced to 50 after a tree-based feature selection. We obtained a purity of 85% adopting a Fuzzy K-Means based algorithm on a random subset of 880 images, containing all the detected phenotypic groups. Finally, we trained a CNN on …",

How humans handle objects can communicate not only the willfulness of the acting, or key aspects of the context where we operate, but also the properties of the objects involved, without any need for explicit verbal description. Since human intelligence comprises the ability to read the context, allowing robots to perform actions that intuitively convey this kind of information would greatly facilitate collaboration. In this work, we focus on how to transfer on two different robotic platforms the same kinematics modulation that humans adopt when manipulating delicate objects, aiming to endow robots with the capability to show carefulness in their movements. We choose to modulate the velocity profile adopted by the robots' end-effector, inspired by what humans do when transporting objects with different characteristics. We exploit a novel Generative Adversarial Network architecture, trained with human kinematics examples, to generalize over them and generate new and meaningful velocity profiles, either associated with careful or not careful attitudes. This approach would allow next generation robots to select the most appropriate style of movement, depending on the perceived context, and autonomously generate their motor action execution.",

Mechanistic models that form the basis of traditional forecasting perform poorly near the ground. In this paper, we take an alternative data-driven approach based on supervised learning. We analyze a massive dataset of wind measured from anemometers located at 10 m height in 32 locations in two central and north west regions of Italy (Abruzzo and Liguria). We train supervised learning algorithms using the past history of wind to predict its value at a future time (horizon). Using data from a single location and time horizon we compare systematically several algorithms where we vary the input/output variables, the memory of the input and the linear vs non-linear learning model. We then compare performance of the best algorithms across all locations and forecasting horizons. We find that the optimal design as well as its performance vary with the location. We demonstrate that the presence of a reproducible diurnal cycle provides a rationale to understand this variation. We conclude with a systematic comparison with state of the art algorithms and show that, when the model is accurately designed, shallow algorithms are competitive with more complex deep architectures.",

A typical approach to enforce uniqueness and select a meaningful solution is to introduce a regularizer. While for most applications the regularizer is convex, in many cases it is not smooth nor strongly convex. In this paper, we propose and study two new iterative regularization methods, based on a primal-dual algorithm, to solve inverse problems efficiently. Our analysis, in the noise free case, provides convergence rates for the Lagrangian and the feasibility gap. In the noisy case, it provides stability bounds and early-stopping rules with theoretical guarantees. The main novelty of our work is the exploitation of some a priori knowledge about the solution set, i.e. redundant information. More precisely we show that the linear systems can be used more than once along the iteration. Despite the simplicity of the idea, we show that this procedure brings surprising advantages in the numerical applications. We discuss various approaches to take advantage of redundant information, that are at the same time consistent with our assumptions and flexible in the implementation. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations for robust sparse recovery and image reconstruction through total variation.

We formalize a framework to learn the Koopman operator from finite data trajectories of the dynamical system. We consider the restriction of this operator to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and introduce a notion of risk, from which different estimators naturally arise. We link the risk with the estimation of the spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator. These observations motivate a reduced-rank operator regression (RRR) estimator.

However, recent work has shown that compared to total variation (TV) minimization, they show similar robustness to adversarial noise in terms of ℓ2-reconstruction error (Genzel et al., 2022). We consider a different notion of robustness, using the ℓ∞-norm, and argue that localized reconstruction artifacts are a more relevant defect than the ℓ2-error. We create adversarial perturbations to undersampled MRI measurements which induce severe localized artifacts in the TV-regularized reconstruction. The same attack method is not as effective against DNN based reconstruction. Finally, we show that this phenomenon is inherent to reconstruction methods for which exact recovery can be guaranteed, as with compressed sensing reconstructions with ℓ1- or TV-minimization.",

Rainfall detection is a fundamental step of acoustical meteorology toward quantifying precipitation and, indirectly, wind. To date, this task has been conducted with some success by using a few frequency bins of the noise spectrum and combining their absolute values and slopes into some inequalities. Unfortunately, these algorithms do not perform well when applied to spectra obtained by averaging multiple noise recordings made over the course of an hour. Supervised, machine learning models allow the use of all the frequency bins in the spectrum, exploiting relationships that are difficult for a human observer to identify. Among the different models tested, a binary classifier based on random forest performed well with moderate computational load. Using a dataset consisting of over 18 000 hourly averaged spectra (approximately 25 months of in situ recordings) and comparing the results with measurements from a surface-mounted rain gauge, the proposed system detects precipitations greater than 1 mm/h with 90% probability, keeping the false alarm probability below 0.5%.

As data size and collection speed increases, manual annotation and database representation are often bottlenecks for utilization of machine learning algorithms for taxonomic classification of plankton species in field studies. In this paper we present a novel set of algorithms to perform accurate detection and classification of plankton species with minimal supervision. Our algorithms approach the performance of existing supervised machine learning algorithms when tested on a plankton dataset generated from a custom-built lensless digital device. Similar results are obtained on a larger image dataset obtained from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Additionally, we introduce a new algorithm to perform anomaly detection on unclassified samples. Here an anomaly is defined as …",

To advance our understanding of the marine ecosystem, for scientific, commercial and survival purposes, more in situ continuous monitoring and analysis of plankton is required. Cost, complexity, power and data communication demands are barriers to widespread deployment of in situ plankton microscopes. We address these barriers by building and characterizing a lensless microscope with a data pipeline optimized for the Raspberry Pi 3. The pipeline records 1080p video of multiple plankton swimming in a sample well while simultaneously detecting, tracking and selecting salient cropped images for classification @ 5.1 frames per second. Thirteen machine learning classifiers and combinations of nine sets of features are evaluated on nine plankton classes, optimized for speed (F1=0.74 @ 1 msec. per image prediction) and accuracy (F1=0.81 @ .80 sec.). System performance results confirm that performing the entire data pipeline from image capture to classification is possible on a low-cost open-source embedded computer.",

The minimization is subject to an affine constraint, that, in particular, allows one to deal with composite problems (a sum of more than three functions) in a separable way by the usual product space technique. While classical conditional gradient methods require Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of the differentiable part of the objective, CGALP needs only differentiability (on an appropriate subset) and hence circumvents the intricate question of Lipschitz continuity of gradients. For the two remaining functions in the objective, we do not require any additional regularity assumption. The second function, possibly nonsmooth, is assumed simple; i.e., the …",

The learning task is then approximately solved as an inverse problem using an adapted parametric model. Previous works in this context have focused on sketches obtained by averaging random features, that while universal can be poorly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose and study the idea of performing sketching based on data-dependent Nystr\""om approximation. From a theoretical perspective we prove that the excess risk can be controlled under a geometric assumption relating the parametric model used to learn from the sketch and the covariance operator associated to the task at hand. Empirically, we show for k-means clustering and Gaussian modeling that for a fixed sketch size, Nystr\""om sketches indeed outperform those built with random features.",

The aim is twofold: to extend von Neumann's theory of liftings to the framework of normed modules, thus providing a notion of precise representative of their elements; to prove that each separable normed module can be represented as the space of sections of a measurable Banach bundle. By combining our representation result with Gigli's differential structure, we eventually show that every metric measure space (whose Sobolev space is separable) is associated with a cotangent bundle in a canonical way.",

We show ergodic convergence in expectation of the Lagrangian optimality gap with a rate of O(1/k) and that every almost sure weak cluster point of the ergodic sequence is a saddle point in expectation under mild assumptions. Under slightly stricter assumptions, we show almost sure weak convergence of the pointwise iterates to a saddle point. Under a relative strong convexity assumption on the objective functions and a total convexity assumption on the entropies of the Bregman divergences, we establish almost sure strong convergence of the pointwise iterates to a saddle point. Our framework is general and does not need strong convexity of the entropies inducing the Bregman divergences in the algorithm. Numerical applications are considered including entropically regularized Wasserstein barycenter problems and regularized inverse problems on the simplex.",

In particular this allows one to compute some gradients, proximal terms, and/or linear minimization oracles in an inexact fashion that facilitates the practical application of the algorithm to computationally intensive settings, e.g., in high (or possibly infinite) dimensional Hilbert spaces commonly found in machine learning problems. The algorithm is able to solve composite minimization problems involving the sum of three convex proper lower-semicontinuous functions subject to an affine constraint of the form Ax = b for some bounded linear operator A. Only one of the functions in the objective is assumed to be differentiable, the other two are assumed to have an accessible proximal operator and a linear minimization oracle. As main results, we show convergence of the Lagrangian values (so-called convergence in the Bregman sense) and asymptotic feasibility of the affine constraint as well as strong convergence of the sequence of dual variables to a solution of the dual problem, in an almost sure sense. Almost sure convergence rates are given for the Lagrangian values and the feasibility gap for the ergodic primal variables. Rates in expectation are given for the Lagrangian values and the feasibility gap subsequentially in the pointwise sense. Numerical experiments verifying the predicted rates of convergence are shown as well.",

The approach explores the dual problem and it generalizes the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM). The practical implementation of the algorithm is based on a spectral decomposition of the operator determining the dynamics of the system. Once this decomposition is available – which can be done offline and saved for future use – the optimal control problem is solved almost instantaneously. It is practically reduced to a scalar nonlinear equation for the optimal Lagrange multiplier. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through numerical …",
